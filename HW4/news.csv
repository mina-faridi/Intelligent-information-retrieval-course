  Federal Reserve Board Governor
  Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
  permitting formation of financial services holding companies
  involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
  securities.
      In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
  and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, ""I believe
  that increased diversification along geographic and product
  lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.""
      He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
  companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
  Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
  insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
  would be handled on functional lines.
      ""Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
  bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
  have to be on an arms-length basis,"" Heller said.
      Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
  special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
      Heller said he ""would require the holding company to serve
  as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
  maintain the bank's capital.
      ""In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
  long as the holding company has a positive net worth.""
      Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
  to own a financial services holding company, again with the
  provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
  if necessary.
      Heller said the effects of these actions ""would be banks
  that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them"" in
  which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
  ""loot the bank"" was removed.
      Such diversification would give access to national and
  international financial services to corporations across the
  United States.
      Heller said that would mean ""the steady decline of America's
  banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested"" by
  permitting them to become more competitive.

  British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay
  7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
  signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
      ""I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
  clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
  think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,""
  said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
  dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
  own.
      ""It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
  war and oil prices are not going to crack,"" said Prescott, Ball
  and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
      ""Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
  energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
  that are acquisition targets,"" Lazier said.
      One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
  energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
  Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
  Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
      Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
  falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
  exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of
  the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
  which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
  that they have become unattractive.
      U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped
  1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
  Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>
  climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
      Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
  71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
  Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
  offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
  would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
      British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
      Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
  the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
  changed its outlook for the oil industry.
      Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
  more bearish positions on oil prices.
      ""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
  barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
  retreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said.
      ""They are more appropriately today looking more
  optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
  (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
  will be exceeded,"" Margoshes said.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
  trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
      Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
  up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
  oil prices were falling last year.
      They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
  more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
  field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
  the Alaskan North Slope.
      Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
  attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
  has hard-to-replace reserves.
      ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
  increase their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witter
  analyst Eugene Nowak said.
      Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
  British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
  stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
  sometime in the year beginning April one.
      After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
  would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
  held in the U.S.
      ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
  into the United States. No other market can handle all that
  stock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
      In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
  revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
  earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.

  Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported
  improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
  five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
  prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
  Michael Angus said.
      He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
  some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
  after being flat for some years.
      Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
  activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
  noted.
      But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
  acquisitions taking place ""from time to time,"" he said.
      The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
  profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
  In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
  three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
      Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
  &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
  earnings dilution.
      However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
  company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
      Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
  - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
  from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
  40 pct by end-1987.
      The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
  Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
  Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
  the change in attributable profit.
      Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
  Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
  that there was no target date for completing the process.
      He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
  realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
  paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
  operates outside Unilever's core activities.
      In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
  considerable expansion in the household products business and
  in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
      However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
  had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
  better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
  of its Surf detergents.

  whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln
  marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.
      The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over
  one billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,
  and led to a tightening of banking regulations.
      The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks
  announced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in
  currency transactions.
      Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when it
  collapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in
  1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bank
  were jailed in 1983.
      But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced
  medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during
  his childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.

10192,"NEXT FEW MONTHS CRUCIAL FOR OIL - HERNANDEZ
  Energy and Mines Minister Arturo
  Hernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oil
  exporters the next few months will be critical to efforts to
  achieve price recovery and stabilize the market.
       Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations have
  already made some strides in their efforts to strengthen the
  market, the danger of a reversal is always present.
      ""March and the next two or three months will be a really
  critical period,"" Hernandez said. He said, ""We will be able to
  define a movement, either towards market stability and price
  recovery or, depending on the market, a reversal.""
      Earlier this week, Hernandez said Venezuela's oil price has
  averaged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date. If
  OPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average
  price, he said, Venezuela's should move up to 16.50 dlrs.
      Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth
  ministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and
  Caribbean oil exporters, formed in 1983.
      Ministers from member states Ecuador, Mexico,
  Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day
  conference, while Colombia is present for the first time as an
  observer.
      Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of
  ideas about the oil market. However, the members will also
  discuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil
  currently before the U.S. Congress.
      Following the opening session, the group of ministers met
  with President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores, the presidential
  palace. The delegations to the conference are headed by
  Hernandez of Venezuela, Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of
  Ecuador, Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago,
  Jose Luis Alcudiai, assistant energy secretary of Mexico and
  Energy Minister Guilermno Perry Rubio of Colombia.

10255,"GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM
  The United States' emphasis on its
  foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real
  problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General
  Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.
       By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion
  dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure
  which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual
  report.
      The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal
  budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government
  spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,
  it said.
      GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct
  in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the
  previous two years.
      GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and
  instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current
  account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower
  investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.
      Raising U.S. Trade barriers ""would result in little or no
  reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,
  increase inflation and reduce world trade,"" it said.
      ""The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient
  domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would
  remain,"" the report said.
      GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year
  because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West
  European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a
  low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third
  World debt management and looming protectionism.
      The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of
  Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.
      The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes
  were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.
      ""Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced
  as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not
  borne out last year,"" the report said.
      GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the
  U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly
  expanding money supply and low dollar.
      ""Such a development could worsen the business climate by
  increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in
  turn, would adversely affect world trade.""
      But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the
  United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes
  foreign products more expensive.
      It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human
  and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the
  goods and services sought from abroad.
      World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,
  about half of the rate of the previous year.
      Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,
  continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT
  said.
      Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while
  their imports increased moderately, although full statistics
  are not available yet, GATT said.
      The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations
  were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,
  Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.

  Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for

  industry sources said.
      They would give no details, noting that the White House had
  not commented on the decision. The administration has been
  under pressure to retaliate.
      There was no immediate announcement on the council's
  decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior
  policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American
  frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices.
      U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on
  the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides
  on the foreign policy implications of retaliation.
      The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a
  last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached
  last July governing trade in semiconductors.
      Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping
  semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to
  U.S.-made semiconductors.
      In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping
  duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.
      The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S.
  Market but has continued in third countries, and that the
  Japanese market remains closed.
      The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous
  call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese
  high technology products containing semiconductors.
      A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor
  industry and from its chief trade union.
      U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan
  would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as
  televisions, video cassette recorders and computers.

  The &lt;British Petroleum Co of
  Australia Ltd> reported a 16.15 mln dlr net loss for 1986
  against a 73.38 mln dlr profit in 1985 after sales fell to 2.27
  billion dlrs from 2.94 billion.
      The British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> unit attributed the
  deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices
  in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss.
      It said government compensation, in the form of subsidies
  to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with
  improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group's
  oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit.
      BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend.
      Commenting on the year's performance, the company said it
  suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine
  because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices.
      The results also included an 11.3 mln dlr extraordinary
  writedown on the value of the laid-up oil exploration drillship
  Regional Endeavour.
      BP Australia said it had sold its 33-1/3 stake in chemical
  maker &lt;CSBP and Farmers Ltd> yielding an extraordinary profit
  of 18.9 mln dlrs and expected to finalise the sale of the 80

  Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd
  &lt;JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new ""B"" shares
  of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two
  dlrs.
      A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total
  1987 dividend of four cents per ""B"" share, while the ""A"" share
  dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a
  share.
      Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986
  net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.
      Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from
  4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.
      It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson
  achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in
  most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG>,
  Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.
      He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong
  Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a
  reorganisation, is ""a long term investment and now stands at a
  level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset
  imbalance.""
      Keswick said the issue of new ""B"" shares will give the group
  ""the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for
  expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which
  has been brought about through the group's recent
  restructuring.""
      He said the new issue is pending approval from both the
  firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate
  adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.
      The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,
  with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to
  the new unit &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>.
      Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two
  companies spun off from Hk Land -- &lt;Mandarin Oriental
  International Ltd> and &lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>
  -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.
      Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs
  last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.
      ""A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,
  continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,""
  Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in
  airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking
  business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.
      Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its
  general trading business in the Middle East in view of the
  continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said
  the operations would be profitable in the longer term.
      He said the firm's function ""has evolved into one primarily
  of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy.""
      He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board
  of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific
  regional board. He gave no further details of the change.
      Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at
  midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had
  fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm
  planned a rights issue.

  The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>
  said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant
  investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net
  will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86
  ended May 31.
      The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to
  603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28
  from 813.0 mln a year earlier.
      Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a
  year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November
  31, BHP said in a statement.
      Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of
  share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to
  620 mln dlrs.
      BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after
  declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a
  one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.
      The bonus is being made from reserves which will not
  qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of
  dividend imputation next July 1.
      The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP
  said.
      BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of
  dividend will be maintained on the increased capital.
      The level of future dividends will be influenced by the
  implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,
  it said.
      As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in
  shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that
  have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.
      BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said
  petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln
  a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.
      BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected
  generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait
  while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic
  sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new
  plant and some operational difficulties.
      The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs
  from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in
  ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.
      The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term,
  reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of &lt;Blue Circle
  Southern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown.

  Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is
  not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese
  international telecommunications company below the legal limit
  of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official
  said.
      In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro
  Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the
  ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.
  Firms that have expressed interest.
      But it does oppose any foreign international
  telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.
      The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition
  to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete
  with the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and
  to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and
  Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said.
      One of the rival firms, &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc>
  (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms
  including General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
  Citibank NA &lt;CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president
  Nobuo Ito said yesterday.
      Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second

  Planning Inc>, along with &lt;C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co
  Inc &lt;MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc &lt;PAC>, both of
  the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.
      The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the
  merger of the two firms because it says the market can only
  support a single KDD competitor.
      It has also rejected management participation by an
  international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,
  arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.
      Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan
  Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a
  merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to
  less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20
  pct, the ministry official said.
      Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor
  would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'
  share, industry analysts said.
      ""Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one
  combined competitor,"" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst
  Darrell Whitten said.
      ""Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up
  to a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an
  extraordinarily large holding,"" Whitten said.
      Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.
      ""They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless
  with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of
  strategies to reduce that share,"" one said.
      Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
  make an official week-long visit to the United States from
  April 29 and hold talks in Washington with President Reagan,
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masaharu Gotoda told reporters.
      Government sources said Nakasone would try to resolve

      Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari will accompany Nakasone,
  ministry officials said.

  Economic Policy Council was recommending trade sanctions
  against Japan for violating the two countries' agreement on

10355,"NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
  visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.
  Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said
  they believed his chances of success were slim.
      Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and
  widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be
  hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.
  President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.
      News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided
  with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus
  last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.
      It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's
  Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action
  against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint
  trade agreement on computer microchips.
      Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one
  designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the
  short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium
  term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.
      But government officials said political infighting could
  rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent
  one from seeing the light of day.
      Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up
  a package of short-term economic measures until after its
  1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would
  amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.
      But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for
  his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by
  opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.
      Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the
  U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling
  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own
  measures.
      He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis
  of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament
  over the budget, political analysts said.
      Officials working on the government's short-term economic
  package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on
  loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to
  pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in
  the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.
      They said a record portion of state investment planned for
  the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first
  half, probably over 80 pct.
      Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy
  Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.
  Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade
  deficit.
      To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also
  likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term
  economic plans.
      A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan
  governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final
  report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days
  before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.
      Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to
  Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are
  likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as
  agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.
      While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed
  as possible, they said the political realities might force them
  to water down some of the committee's recommendations.
      A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy
  might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes
  massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee
  projects that the current account surplus will fall to less
  than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national
  product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which
  measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct
  of gnp.
      The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for
  Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual
  appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around
  1993, from 150 now.

  &lt;Brierley Investments Ltd> (BIL)
  launched a full takeover bid for the supermarket group

      BIL said in a statement the offer is conditional on minimum
  acceptances totalling 30 mln shares, just under 25 pct of the
  120.4 mln Progressive shares on issue.
      Progressive is currently involved in a proposed merger with
  &lt;Rainbow Corp Ltd>. Rainbow earlier this week raised its stake
  in Progressive to 52 pct. BIL opposes the Rainbow merger and
  analysts say BIL needs a 25 pct stake in Progressive to prevent
  it occurring.
      The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbow
  both receiving shares in a new company &lt;Astral Pacific Corp
  Ltd> on a one-for-one exchange basis.
      The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it would
  offer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full
  bid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate between
  BIL and Rainbow.
      BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he
  opposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL sees
  Progressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.
  BIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds.
      Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based. Chairman
  Allan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed only
  at dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests of
  Progressive shareholders.
      Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved the
  merger proposal. It has also been approved by the Commerce
  Commission, but BIL's bid is still subject to the Commission's
  scrutiny.

10375,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.

  Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F.
  Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactory
  profit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but
  U.S. Sales anticipated higher.
      Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales
  were expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from
  11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000
  from 28,670 last year.
      Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last
  month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70
  mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.
      For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this
  year to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,
  Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were
  based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he
  added.
      The expected drop in West German sales this year would be
  the result of the so-called ""grey market"" for Porsche cars, he
  said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many
  Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal
  export to the U.S.
      Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87
  first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.
      The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger
  percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose
  problems for profit, the Porsche board said.
      In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around
  20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time
  Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the
  1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.
      Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln
  marks.
      In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-party
  orders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre in
  Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for
  the first time.
      Porsche's net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in
  1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85.

  Westinghouse Electric Corp said

  in the double digit range through 1989.
      In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenues
  of 10.7 billion dlrs.
      Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, Douglas
  Danforth, Westinghouse's chairman, said the company's sales
  growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, ""given
  an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth
  course."" He also said the company will make acquisitions, but
  he did not specify particular targets.
      Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told the
  analysts ""our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr
  acquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.
  Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition
  that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will
  consider it."" He said the company would consider an acquisition
  candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's
  primiary businesses.
      Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key
  areas including defense electronics, financial services,
  broadcasting, electrical products and services for construction
  and industrial and utility markets.
      Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow
  faster than the markets the corportation serves and ""surely
  faster than GNP.""
      He said earnings per share growth is expected to
  consistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and
  return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range.
      Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,
  told the analysts ""we will consider buying back stock"" but
  there are no current plans for such a buyback.
      Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings
  it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that
  Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder
  value.
      Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs

  The British government may revoke the
  licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies
  operating in London's financial City when they come up for
  renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up
  Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources
  said.
      ""We can't say ""yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)""
  but this is definitely being considered,"" an official said.
      His comments came after the government was formally urged
  today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint
  retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.
      Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese
  trade practices. ""There's a sense of urgency here now, but the
  emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in
  Japan,"" another government official told Reuters.
      Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that
  Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the
  Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate
  against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.
      She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.
      The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7
  billion stg, official figures show.
      A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the
  U.K. Government to ""coordinate action with the President of the
  United States, and through the Department of Trade and
  Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese
  communications companies for equipment approval by the British
  Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further
  applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences""
  until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called
  ""restrictive conditions"" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)
  (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in
  Japan's international telecommunications market.
      The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section
  of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.
  Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on
  the Conservative government to take firm action.
      Officials said another option now being considered by the
  U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese
  institutions. That could be done under the government's
  proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.
      58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal
  in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based
  firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.
      The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain
  an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied
  under legally-binding international trade agreements.
      ""The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry
  Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in
  investment, banking and insurance,"" one official said.
      ""This point has been made to the Japanese at official level
  a number times,"" the official added.
      Britain and France are now working together to urge that
  the European Community take collective action against Japan,
  but by working within EC treaties, another official said.
      British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio
  interview that the European Community should build barriers
  against Japanese imports through certification procedures
  similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.
      ""There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,"" he
  said, adding ""(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight.""
  Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade
  ""strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a
  fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is
  itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our
  own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.""
      The situation is only likely to worsen following news that
  Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more
  than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs
  from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.
      But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible
  trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.
      Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial
  institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather
  than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global
  business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest
  securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.
      In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan
  was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for
  breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.
      There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on
  the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb
  Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the
  move could come today or early next week.
      Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
  included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which
  use semiconductors.

  at their present parities.
      Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
  crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
      A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
  negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
  on currency movements.
      Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off

  Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said

      As a result, the company retroactively charged all past
  exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
  properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.
      Under the new policy, all future exploration and related
  administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
  than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.
      Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln
  U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately
  disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.
      The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
  affect working capital position, future cash flows or the
  company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it

      Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of
  costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln
  U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other
  mine developments.
      Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the
  Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
  life of the mine and charged against future earnings.
      The change will also result in lower depreciation and
  amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an
  ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total
  estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.
      Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is

  Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial
  officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange
  controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls,
  a cabinet statement said.
      The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and
  Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce
  Taiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a
  record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month.
      Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry
  and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease
  the controls, but he did not give details.
      Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the
  foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The
  controls would be used during emergency.
      Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade
  surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion
  in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade
  with the United States, according to official figures.
      But he said that while easing the controls would help
  reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a
  short time.
      Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from
  growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest
  trading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports.
      Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told
  Reuters: ""The decision came a little bit late. But it was better
  than never.""
      Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said
  the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange
  controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with
  its trading partners, especially the United States.
      ""The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange
  controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help
  our own economic problems,"" he said.
      He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost
  Taiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February.

      Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman
  Shoichi Saba stated: ""EIAJ believes that it is premature and
  even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the
  agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months
  after concluding the agreement.""
      ""We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the
  decision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese
  efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and to
  resist emotional biases,"" he said.
      Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as
  300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for
  what is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of the
  pact.
      The agreement, struck late last year after months of heated
  negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
  on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makers
  to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral
  organisation designed to promote chip imports.
      Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three
  mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and
  expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.
      ""This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers may
  not be really interested in participating in the Japanese
  market,"" he said.

  Lebanese central bank Vice Governor
  Meguerditch Bouldikian called for the establishment of an Arab
  fund to assist the Lebanese pound, which has lost more than 80
  pct of its value against the dollar since January 1986.
      Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the
  bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency.
      But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its
  war-battered economy now more than ever before. ""We expect a
  common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks
  and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and
  preserve the value of the currency when needed,"" he said.
      Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive
  sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and
  budget deficits.
      Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in
  reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. ""These are
  encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet,"" he said.
      ""We believe that with a just political solution acceptable
  to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the
  Lebanese pound and Lebanon.""
      In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main
  goals:
      1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit
      2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank
  financing institutions in financing the deficit
      3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign

  Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun said
  plans to scrap the country's parallel currency, Foreign
  Exchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due to
  objections from foreign businessmen and others.
      But Tian told a news conference the Chinese government
  still considered FECs unsatisfactory.
      Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs,
  Tian said: ""We have decided to postpone the question. As to
  whether it will be done in the future, it will be done
  according to the evolution of the situation.""
      He said many people, including foreign businessmen, had
  raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, and
  added: ""It is rather complicated.""
      The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners in
  China. But they now circulate widely among local residents and
  there is a big black market in the currency, though it is
  theoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency,
  renminbi.
      Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had
  ""many demerits and negative influences.""
      Bank of China President Wang Deyan told Reuters earlier
  this month that he thought it unlikely that the certificates
  would be scrapped this year.
      Western diplomats and economists have said the Chinese
  authorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative.

  the government had decided it was ideologically unacceptable to

10623,"NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded
  a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the
  United States over trade in computer microchips.
      ""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by
  explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that
  need to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
  saying.
      While expressing regret over America's decision to impose
  tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said
  Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington
  to help settle the dispute.
      Government officials said Japan would make a formal request
  next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would
  probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17
  deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
      Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan
  investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are
  dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.
      Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic
  goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to
  live up to their bilateral chip pact.
      That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of
  heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price
  chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.
      Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory
  than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,
  who earlier today said Japan was ready to take ""appropriate
  measures"" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.
      Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's
  remark and said that his main message was that the two sides
  need to talk urgently about the issue.
      But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the
  United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international
  organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed
  the tariffs.
      Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article
  23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they
  said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel
  to consider the legality of the U.S. Action.
      But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. ""It
  may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United
  States may lift its decision at an early date,"" Tamura said.
      In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President
  Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had
  evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world
  markets and had opened up its own market to imports.
      Japanese government officials said they are confident they
  can make the pact work.
      They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips
  through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after
  MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.
      While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese
  imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the
  ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.
      The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,
  some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their
  purchases of foreign semiconductors.
      A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>

  The Emirates Industrial Bank has
  predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states
  following higher oil revenues.
      A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said
  total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
  countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from
  33.5 billion in 1986.
      The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
  and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
      The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil
  prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain
  overall group production.
      These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight
  dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.
      ""All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in
  the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected
  growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,""
  the study said.
      It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher
  budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past
  recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.
      The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise
  to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.
      It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined
  trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in
  1985.

  Gulf Arab states must coordinate

  Arab currency traders meeting: ""We have to start with
  coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common
  system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go
  yet.""
      He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a
  plausible project.
      The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi
  Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
  Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to

      At present, five currencies are linked either officially or
  in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is
  pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.
      A common currency system or EMS-style ""grid"" would, in
  theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable
  exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a
  very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain
  small. ""Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their
  infancy,"" he said.
      Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a
  paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that
  often does not recognise the western banking concept of

  Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
  chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
  trade war, government officials said.
      ""We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
  an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
  States,"" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  official said.
       On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
  alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
      That agreement, reached last year after heated
  negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
  in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
  fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
  end of April.
      While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
  the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
  it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
  the trip's success, they said.
      ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,""
  one official told Reuters. ""We would very much like to do
  something to respond to that.""
      In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
  spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
  U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
  makers, not to the government.
      Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
  angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
  forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
  dispute, trade analysts said.
      They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
  chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
  draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
  included enforced production cuts.
      The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
  announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
  the government faces in taking further action.
      ""Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
  U.S./Japan agreement,"" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
  Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
      He accused the U.S. Of being ""irrational."" He said the U.S.
  Action had made the bilateral chip pact ""meaningless.""
      Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
  through consultations.
      Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
  Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
  go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
      Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
  plans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a joint
  investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping.

  Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG &lt;AMVG.F>, AMB, said.
      But total operating and extraordinary profits, including
  earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own
  account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,
  were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.
      BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's
  capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company's
  acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.
      Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an
  unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an
  unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,
  &lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from which
  AMB has acquired the majority stake.
      The bank has said its business last year suffered from the
  turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing
  concern Neue Heimat.
      AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to
  50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.
      The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from
  981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the
  interest margin to 1.9 pct.
      A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from
  188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.
      The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up
  risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised
  because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.
      Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German
  accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,
  rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.
      BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in
  1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct
  of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for
  14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.

10693,"INDONESIA LIMITS OIL PRICE IMPACT-FINANCE MINISTER
  Indonesia has minimised the economic
  impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and
  boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.
      Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in
  crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.
      But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling
  President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in
  the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the
  previous year.
      Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,
  although he did not give complete figures.
      The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general
  elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,
  palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.
      Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the
  appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against
  the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.
      He said the economy would have suffered more from the world
  economic recession if the government had not devalued the
  rupiah by 31 pct last September.
      In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post
  said the government must press ahead with measures to
  deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.
      The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were
  needed to finance not only imports but also the country's
  growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.
      ""About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due
  within the next three to five years and will steadily increase
  the debt servicing burden,"" the paper said.
      However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in
  expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers
  said.
      Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's
  nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate
  rebound to halt further dollar depreciation.
      A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the
  April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this
  afternoon were taken favourably by the market.

  The Japanese government appears to have
  little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over
  computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.
      The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300
  mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the
  microchip trade signed last September.
      A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters ""Japan has done
  what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait
  for those steps to take effect.""
      The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September
  agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in
  non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.
  Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.
       Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut
  production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in
  third countries at non-regulated prices.
      ""I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,"" said
  Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.
      A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call
  for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it
  would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.
      Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they
  would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita
  Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in
  imports was not likely.
      Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if
  the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be
  levied on consumer electronics products rather than on
  microchips themselves.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,
  there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,""
  said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.
      ""The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be
  stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be
  delayed for another year,"" he said.
      Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by
  stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan
  for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.
      ""The American approach is full of contradictions,"" Jardine
  Fleming's Edwards said.
      ""If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they
  want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that
  hurts the final market,"" Edwards said.
      But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.
  Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also
  frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts
  argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have
  to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.
      Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,
  said ""The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic
  economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.""

  BASF AG said
  the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the
  fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated
  in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic
  production.
      But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group
  said it expected satisfactory business development over the
  next months. ""At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary
  influences such as there were last year,"" it said. Orders in
  hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.
      BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax
  profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.
      The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year
  also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and
  forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.
      The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on
  stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In
  the parent company, the positive earnings development
  continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to
  1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was
  balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in
  raw materials. 
      In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47
  billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell
  8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.
      Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine
  chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in
  those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.
      Results from these had been taken only partly into the
  fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.

10704,"BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME
  Bahrain is introducing a new domestic
  money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on
  the island's newly launched treasury bill programme.
      The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all
  commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which
  gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in
  treasury bills, or through discounting them.
      The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current
  arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be
  valid except ""in quite exceptional circumstances.""
      Under the current system, the agency provides the island's
  20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term
  swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term
  loans secured against government development bonds.
      ""The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace
  these operations with short-term assistance based on Government
  of Bahrain treasury bills,"" the circular to banks states.
      The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a
  simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a
  higher price which will reflect an interest charge.
      The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will
  normally be for a period of seven days.
      Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of
  91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since
  raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.
      Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have
  been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered
  by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from
  April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury
  bills in case they need funds from the central bank.
      Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold
  treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper
  could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted
  yields slightly.
      Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had
  started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.
      Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through
  repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar
  swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would
  foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying
  treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.

      Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become

  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX),

  exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.
      He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between
  1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third
  quarter this year.
      The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve
  clients in the region and educate financial markets about the

      Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by
  exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the
  exchange-trade currency option market against existing
  over-the-counter option trading during the local working day.
      Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
  an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
  had grown in popularity, he said.
      The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including
  a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000

  the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000
  contracts traded daily.
      Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the
  Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,
  set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase

  Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
  chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
  trade war, government officials said.
      ""We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
  an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
  States,"" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  official said.
       On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
  alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
      That agreement, reached last year after heated
  negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
  in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
  fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
  end of April.
      While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
  the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
  it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
  the trip's success, they said.
      ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,""
  one official told Reuters. ""We would very much like to do
  something to respond to that.""
      In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
  spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
  U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
  makers, not to the government.
      Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
  angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
  forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
  dispute, trade analysts said.
      They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
  chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
  draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
  included enforced production cuts.
      The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
  announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
  the government faces in taking further action.
      ""Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
  U.S./Japan agreement,"" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
  Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
      He accused the U.S. of being ""irrational."" He said the U.S.
  action had made the bilateral chip pact ""meaningless.""
      Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
  through consultations.
      Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
  Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
  go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
      Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
  plans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a joint
  investigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping.

  shareholders to wait until its board renders an opinion before

  reviewing alternative transactions which might provide GenCorp
  shareholders with a payment other than cash.
      ""If that is the case, you should recognize that our
  additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash
  and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide
  in any similarly structured transaction,"" the partnership said.
      General Acquisition also said it believes that GenCorp's
  board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction
  it may propose to shareholders in a manner that would allow for
  competing offers.
      The partnership requested that if any other proposal is
  under consideration that it be given the same information
  available to GenCorp's managers and advisers in constructing a

  another buyout proposal that it also be given an opportunity to
  bid on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision
  is made.
      General Acquisition repeated its request that GenCorp
  remove its ""poison pill"" or shareholders rights plan.

  ""environment for fair competition,"" it will take all steps
  necessary to create such an enviroment.
      It said it may take legal action or seek the support of
  shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board

  expected to spur diversification into investment assets
  including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said.
      The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low
  of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York
  finish, then recovered to 96.20-22.
      Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment

  positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are
  sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest
  rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency
  trader said.
      The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will
  further promote diversification into other foreign investments,
  as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock
  markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers
  said.
      They said major Japanese investors in the past two years
  are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign
  portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S.
  Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct.
      Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking
  substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh
  funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the
  Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and
  gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the

      Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed
  into local bond and stock markets as well.
      The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record

  compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit.
      The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for
  more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not
  satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said.
      A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in
  U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market.
  The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due to

  half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with
  average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of

      The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitude
  towards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of
  total foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers

      Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the

10905,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. CONGRESS RAPS JAPAN
  The U.S. Congress is making Japan,
  with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the
  U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around
  America's record trade deficit.
      ""Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the
  challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of
  government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers
  to our exports,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.
      ""If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade
  problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,""
  the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee
  hearing on the trade bill.
      Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have
  made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging
  bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.
      Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs
  in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14
  billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.
      Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade
  deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to
  the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to
  press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.
      They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration
  in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.
      In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.
  semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he
  intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese
  electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by
  a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.
      Congress also has been been angered by the administration's
  lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues
  including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications
  goods, and financial services.
      The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in
  four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and
  measures to force the administration take tough action against
  foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.
      Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many
  cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese
  products or make them more expensive with higher duties.
      The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House
  Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to
  force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign
  competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win
  temporary relief from surges in imports.
      The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict
  imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not
  buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.
      Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant
  from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key
  Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.
      The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West
  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does
  not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would
  set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per
  cent a year for three years.
      ""I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say
  to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't
  compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken
  away from American business,"" Gephardt said.
      The administration has said it could not support a trade
  bill containing such a provision.

110,"AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF
  American Express Co remained silent on
  market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
  considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
  value of its stock.
      American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
  market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
  good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
  Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
  services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
      American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
  72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
      American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
  stock activity.
      Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
  meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
  yesterday of management changes.
      At the meeting, company officials said American Express
  stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
  of Shearson, according to analysts.
      Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
  operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
  president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
  positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
      Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
  sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
  spinoff.
      Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
  Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
  American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
  year.
      ""I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
  going to sell shearson,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
  He questioned what would be a better investment than ""a very
  profitable securities firm.""
      Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
  cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
  asset.
      But others believe the company could very well of
  considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
  rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
      Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
  believes American Express could have considered a partial
  spinoff in the past.
      ""Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
  big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
  the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
  probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
  capitalization,"" said Eckenfelder.
      Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
  it plans to expand globally.
      ""They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
  capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
  enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
  road,"" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
      ""They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
  in the future, which goes heavily into the international
  arena,"" said Lewis. ""...That does not preclude acquisitions and
  divestitures along the way,"" he said.
      Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
  brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
  better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
  services business.
      ""It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
  to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
  higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
  the total operating earnings of the company,"" he said.
       Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
  operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

11000,"PARIS MEET AGREED NOT TO PUBLISH BANDS - LAWSON
  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in
  Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection
  with their pact to stabilise currencies.
      Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why
  the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson
  replied, ""we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.""
  When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float
  with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said ""I do not
  want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not
  to make it easy for"" speculation against the accord.
      Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual
  countries would take corrective action if their currency began
  reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.
      But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,
  Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid
  through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.
      ""It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having
  difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate
  appreciations and making their economies more domestically
  oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to
  make its own economy more export oriented,"" Lawson said.
      In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury
  Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's
  current level, adding that ""It is an objective ... To try to
  keep it around that level.""
      He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had
  changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the
  pound had weathered that period so successfully. ""There has been
  a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,"" Lawson said.  He
  disagreed with what he termed ""the grossly exaggerated claim""
  that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of
  other major industrialsed countries.
      Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank
  rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real
  interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and
  only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.
      Lawson confirmed that ""over the medium and longer term, the
  government's objective is zero inflation.""
      He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at
  1.0 pct of GDP ""is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget
  doctrine.""  He added that ""to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain
  constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply
  a recipe for accelerating inflation.""

  U.S. refiners will have to
  reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said
  industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners
  Association meeting here.
       ""If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine
  about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to
  pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second
  quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of
  petroluem products at Conoco Inc
      ""If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,"" he added.
       Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that
  U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,
  with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week
  ended March 20.
       The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, 
  distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago
  levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2
  mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7
  mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the
  API said.
       Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp
  &lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to
  profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream
  operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.
       ""The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it
  continues,"" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of
  refining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S.
  subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.
       Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given
  the current level of demand but the operating level should
  increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,
  Buckler said.
       Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.
  refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude
  per day. ""I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries
  over the next five years,"" he said, adding that these
  facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude
  oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to
  refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.

  The Bass Group, once thought by
  analysts to be eager to sell its holdings in Taft Broadcasting
  Co, emerged as another potential bidder for the Ohio
  broadcasting company.
      The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it had
  talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers
  and directors ""concerning participation in a group to acquire
  control"" of the company.
      The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft
  stockholders and members of Taft management about participating
  in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the
  wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify
  any of the other people with whom it had talks.
      Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman
  Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion
  dlr offer for the company.
      At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser,
  Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and
  to supply financial data to other interested bidders.
      ""If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president
  is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them
  backing him on any deal,"" said one analyst, who asked not to be
  identified.
      ""I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like
  they're going to join the group and buy themselves out,"" said
  Edward Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
  and Co.
      Analysts have speculated that Carl Lindner may be
  interested in acquiring the company. they speculated he may be
  one of the shareholders in talks with the bass group.
      Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2
  pct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment.
      Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of
  Taft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values
  for the company.

  A high level U.S. trade official

      Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate
  against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce
  Smart replied, ""That would be the height of foolishness.""
      In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in
  meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual
  imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.
      Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United
  States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned
  about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the
  record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.
      President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from
  the two Democratic leaders of Congress.
      ""I think it's about time,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert
  Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright
  of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House
  session, ""It just shows we were right all along when we said
  something needs doing.""
      Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing
  that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S.
  negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.
      Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up
  Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last
  year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the
  United States in these products.
      Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.
      ""It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I
  hope it will persuade them we're serious,"" Smart said of the
  White House trade sanctions.
      The United States has tried to convince Japanese car
  companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw
  them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.
      ""All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them
  we can do better than our reputation seems to be,"" he said.
      Measured per car, each American-made car contained about
  700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car
  contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said.

  The U.S. Department of

  proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American
  Airlines Inc.
      ""The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen
  competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest,"" the
  DOT said in a statement.
      AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a
  unit of AMR Corp.
      The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan
  Feb. 20.
      American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of
  revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small
  carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the
  nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not
  alter American's third-place ranking, according to data
  compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.
      The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.
  market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.
      The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially
  reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers
  provide either nonstop or single-plane service.
      At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT
  said it found no evidence that other carriers could not
  increase or begin service that competed with a merged
  American-AirCal.
      Concerning the 14th, ""While entry may not be possible at the
  Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the
  service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,
  especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will
  provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in
  long-haul markets,"" the DOT said.
      The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the
  authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County
  terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal
  building limit future opportunities for expansion.
      The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments
  opposing the merger but ""raised no new facts or arguments.""

  Development of costly shale oil,
  liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in
  recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies,
  will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a
  barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.
      Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after
  addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of
  Chemical Engineers, ""By early in the next century, synthetics
  should play a significant role in this country's energy
  supply.""
      McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he
  believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when
  world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.
      ""You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil
  prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be
  prepared,"" McMillan said.
      He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct
  annually in the next few years while the nation fails to
  replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of
  the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher
  because of declining supplies, McMillan said.
      Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the
  meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help
  spur development of synthetic fuels.
      The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons
  of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that
  of all the world's known oil reserves.
      ""We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels
  competitive later,"" Hall said. The average lead time for
  development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between
  five and ten years.
      Until last year, the federal government had subsidized
  synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a
  research program created during the Carter Administration with
  the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels
  of oil.
      The corporation was shut down last April when Congress
  refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget
  because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a
  barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

11123,"CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS
  Canada's major banks will likely face
  stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing
  if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the
  end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.
      American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt
  talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks
  would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.
      Such action ""would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian
  banks to do the same,"" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank
  analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters.
      ""They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,"" said
  Pulcine, ""and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing
  basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot
  of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering
  the loans non-performing and another bank is not.""
      Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any
  willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp
  &lt;CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than
  let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling
  example for other creditor banks.
      ""In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have
  to have the support of the other banks,"" said Meredith.
      Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd
  said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify,
  ""wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis
  and is trying to encourage the others to take that position.""
      Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs
  by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on
  its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.
      Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days
  before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest
  as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days.
  They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until
  late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending
  July 31.
      &lt;Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank
  creditor, said last week it was not currently considering
  declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as
  non-performing.
      ""I think that is just for the benefit of the public,"" Walsh
  said of Bank of Montreal's statement. 
      Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian
  banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans
  non-performing.
      They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by
  the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks
  to recoup their lost interest income.
      ""From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks
  will get the money,"" said Meredith. ""My outlook at this point is
  optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's
  earnings.""
      Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of
  3.80 dlrs for &lt;Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in
  1986; 4.30 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25
  dlrs for &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with
  2.23;  2.15 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94,
  and 2.85 dlrs for &lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74.
      She forecast 1.90 dlrs for &lt;National Bank of Canada>
  against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.
      Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings
  estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share,
  assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs.
      ""If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the
  fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a
  share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario,"" Pulcine said.
      Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the
  Brazilian debt situation was so complex that ""it could drag on
  beyond one full fiscal year.""
      He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings
  forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly
  interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs
  or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.

      Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior
  alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the
  full value of the company.
      In a letter to shareholders, Chairman A. William Reynolds 
  said the offer is a ""highly conditional, contingently financed
  bust-up offer"" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value
  of their investment in Gencorp.
      Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the
  offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He
  said the board has authorized management to explore
  alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a
  ""financially superior"" alternative to the general acquisition
  offer.
      A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would not
  comment on market speculation that the company's management may
  develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not
  comment on when a better alternative might be developed.
      Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer
  price since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at
  114-1/4, up 1-5/8.
      Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years,
  Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder
  value, and the stock price and earnings have improved since he
  joined the company.
      Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a ""bargain price""
  acquisition that was ""using financing from a syndicate of banks
  that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman
  brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide.""
      Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical
  alteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including Aerojet
  General to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the
  profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of
  shareholders.
      The letter also said the General Acquisition offer
  ""jeopardizes the security and interests"" of its shareholders,
  employees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughout
  the country where the company's facilities are located.

  The U.S. should reassess
  its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on
  imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for
  Strategic and International Studies.
       ""The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the
  Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission
  report, mandate more than ever before the need for a
  fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,""
  Ebinger said.
       He remarks were made in an address to the National
  Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.
       ""Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct
  link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the
  current environment it will be increasingly difficult for
  moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.
  interests,"" Ebinger said.
       Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude
  oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be
  weaker if demand falls in the spring.
      But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said
  crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.
      There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at
  the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance
  that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of
  the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.
      He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement
  to restrict production.
      OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June
  because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has
  declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.
      OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar
  has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.
      Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to
  four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to
  two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd.

      It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit

  related to its &lt;Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses
  and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not

      Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have
  been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid
  rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,
  political analysts said.
      Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform
  plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic
  summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later
  next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal
  Democratic Party (LDP), they said.
      ""The close relationship between Nakasone and President
  Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,""
  Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida
  told Reuters. ""So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages
  Nakasone.""
      Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was
  encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but
  also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.
      ""Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from
  Nakasone,"" Uchida said. ""His position within the LDP itself is
  not so strongly established today.""
      Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public
  than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support
  eroded, the analysts said.
      The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on
  Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade
  pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the
  analysts said.
      ""Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and
  Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,"" Rei Shiratori, director of
  the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.
      This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's
  credibility, Shiratori told Reuters.
      The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's
  rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses
  in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.
      ""If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to
  resign early,"" Shiratori said.
      But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers
  before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,

  quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to
  Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very
  hostile audience,"" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist
  William Sterling.
      ""If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the
  final nail in his coffin,"" he said.
      Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing
  Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue
  against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts
  said.
      But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled
  with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to
  Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the
  differences and aid Nakasone, they said.
      ""One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is
  not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,"" Sterling said.

  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp &lt;XON>
  unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR
  has agreed to sell its &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for
  985 mln Australian dlrs.
      The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
  statement.
      The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
  interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.
      Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which
  holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led
  Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
      In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
  in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
  prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
  interests in the next two years, the statement said.
      ""The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
  be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
  float,"" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
      Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
  efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
  materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
  experience and strong market leadership.
      With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
  more aggressively and earlier, he said.
      As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi
  sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer
  Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its
  entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.
      After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is
  Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current
  gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas
  liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic
  feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said.
      The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken
  Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshore
  production in Australia, they said.
      Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist
  in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the
  Cooper-Eromanga area.
      ""These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in
  oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass
  Strait production now under way,"" McGill said.
      In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman
  said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of
  CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso.
      He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision
  in view of the risks associated with the oil business.
      The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share
  equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more
  than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.
      Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to
  net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,
  will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.
      However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets
  will significantly reduce this loss, he said.
      He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future
  prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core
  businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable
  in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents
  against 18 in 1985/86.

11198," EUROPE ON SIDELINES IN U.S-JAPAN MICROCHIP ROW
  Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and
  electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they
  generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest
  trade row between the United States and Japan.
      Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,
  as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade
  practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.
      The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit
  with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese
  trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.
      But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting
  with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.
      ""The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the
  U.S.,"" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy
  Research Centre in London. ""Basically, their policies are pretty
  much the same.""
      But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or
  that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of
  the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,
  Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.
      ""In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,"" he
  added. ""In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of
  free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that
  liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.""
      Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's
  tendency to impose so-called ""countervailing duties"" - an import
  tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.
      In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to
  be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.
      In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has
  threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic
  goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has
  failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.
      But the European Community has challenged the agreement as
  a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.
      ""It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of
  the United States in defence of the agreement,"" said Wolf.
      Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough
  line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest
  of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take
  the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.
      A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told
  Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position
  since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a
  strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.
      In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign
  ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and
  appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after
  the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.
      Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no
  signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging
  sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a
  trade war, they said.
      Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in
  European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,
  cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to
  try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.
      In Britain, where the government is angered over the
  difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has
  faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said
  last week that retaliatory action is being considered.
      But government officials said last night, ""We are not
  talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.""
      They said the government would consider its options at a
  cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions
  were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the
  Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial
  markets, government officials said.

11225,"JAPAN TO CUT MICROCHIP OUTPUT, BOOST IMPORTS
  Leading domestic semiconductor makers
  will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips
  from next month in line with government attempts to ward off
  U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.
      The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the
  sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the
  plans, analysts said.
      The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of
  products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to
  honour a semiconductor trade pact.
      In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan
  said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory
  pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.
      But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said
  yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop
  the tariffs if Japan shows a ""clear indication"" that it will open
  its markets to U.S. Goods.
      The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has
  urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the
  second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more
  than 20 pct the previous quarter.
      MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.
      Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to
  cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.
      ""The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword
  and shown that it can and will do business,"" said analyst Nick
  Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.
      But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can
  cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of
  the sanctions -- is more difficult.
      ""The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's
  (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer
  products. They're well supplied here,"" said Richard May, senior
  analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.
      The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,
  but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end
  production skills, the analysts said.
      ""The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on
  semiconductors in return for free access to other areas,"" said
  Edwards.
      A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T>, said the firm's
  reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory
  (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the
  trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of
  the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.
      Company officials unveiled the following plans -
      - NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to
  slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to
  six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last
  quarter.
       In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip
  imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip
  consumption the year before.
      - Hitachi Ltd's &lt;HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will
  fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The
  company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific
  target. Imports are currently very low.
      - Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM
  production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is
  considering ways to boost imports, a company official said.
      Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell
  the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a
  joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern
  Japan.
      - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second
  quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln
  chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased
  imports but an official said ""boosting imports will be difficult
  as it depends on sales demand.""
      - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with
  MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.
      - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April
  production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways
  to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning
  April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five

  (Lasmo) &lt;LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices rise
  again and it is confident this will happen early in the next
  decade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.
      Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil and
  gas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oil
  equivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every year
  since 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.
      The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,
  down from 118 mln in 1985.
      It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.
      The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in
  oil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,
  which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln
  stg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for
  lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.
      The company said had very few exploration wells committed
  for 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in its
  exploration program. Even without further success, the existing
  fields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly to
  profit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.
      Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement.

11234,"CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS
  One or two large West German banks
  effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at
  the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from
  their overnight deposits, money dealers said.
      As a result, call money soared in active trading to around
  the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as
  banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.
      Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily
  51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the
  central bank over the first 29 days of the month.
      Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7
  billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.
      To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise
  holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and
  tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because
  banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of
  Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for
  three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.
      Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,
  flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return
  until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.
      Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,
  commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five
  billion marks or so.
      With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the
  month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,
  draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought
  funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess
  funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.
      One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced
  knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its
  sales of treasury bills on Friday.
      Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total
  minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank
  has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate
  the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.
      ""(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not
  selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this
  amount,"" he said. ""If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the
  market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will
  be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.""
      But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in
  rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.
      International central banks have been at pains to prevent a
  dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.
  Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer
  undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.
      ""The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between
  three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today
  cannot be very popular,"" the senior dealer said.
      Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average
  rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or
  four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned
  without the excessive draining through the treasury bill
  mechanism.
      Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations
  between Germany's major employers and the unions, the
  Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to
  monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.
      Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the
  Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion
  marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.

  985 mln Australian dlrs.
      The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
  statement.
      The previously announced float of part of its Delhi

      Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which
  holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led
  Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
      In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
  in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
  prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
  interests in the next two years, the statement said.
      ""The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will

      Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
  efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
  materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
  experience and strong market leadership.
      With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
  more aggressively and earlier, he said.
      As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi

      CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued

      The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share

  market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.
      CSR said it will announce further details of the offer
  soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer
  Sugar stock.
      It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer
  Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net
  earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
  yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already
  contained an element of takeover speculation.
      It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last
  reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.
      CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
  which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and
  Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.
      These economies can only be achieved through CSR control
  and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.
      The takeover announcement came soon after CSR's earlier

  Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> expects a
  difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief
  executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.
      Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in
  foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher
  mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer
  nations.
      Domestic business was also declining and orders for West
  German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,
  Dieter said.
      Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.
      Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a
  set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started
  last year, were now having an effect.
      Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products
  accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The
  company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter
  said had become one of Mannesmann's ""strategic aims.""
      He said the company's drive to combine activities in
  mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular ""plus
  point"" for Mannesmann.
      Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take
  a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group
  for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall
  nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net
  profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.
      It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar
  and lack of demand for steel pipe.
      Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe
  were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added
  the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this

  possible trade war, and he added that a trade war would not be
  in the interests of Britain.
      Lawson told journalists that ""the prospects for the (U.K.)
  economy look very very good - providing we can avoid a trade
  war."" He stressed that ""a heavy responsiblity in different ways
  lies on Japan and the United States to ensure that we do avoid
  such a trade war.""
      Asked whether he believed such a trade war could be
  averted, Lawson replied, ""I very much hope so.""
      Britain last week warned that it would retaliate if Japan
  did not move soon to open its markets to outside competition.
      Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave notice that the U.K.
  Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent (Cable
  and Wireless Plc) (CAWL.L) from taking a significant position
  in a new Japanese international telecommunications venture.
      But British officials are now trying to dampen
  anti-Japanese rhetoric, to try to keep developments under
  control.
      The British Conservative government will on Thursday
  consider what legal options are available to it to try to
  increase U.K. Access to Japanese markets, officials said.

  &lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi> is studying a
  project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49
  pct of its French unit &lt;European Sugar (France)> and could
  raise around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.
      Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was
  aimed at ""international markets"" and that the figure of 400 mln
  dlrs given in some press reports ""was probably about right.""
      European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania
  Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb the
  European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc
  &lt;CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.
      Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to
  buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.
      A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was
  studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar
  along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but
  gave no details.
      The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial
  analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the
  CPC business.
      In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer
  &lt;Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi
  was ""apparently still organising finance,"" his company might
  still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business.
      Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630
  mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid ""at the
  date foreseen in the preliminary contract.""
      Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any
  indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in
  European Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's
  purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by
  September 30.
      Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and
  disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's
  European business was apparently rejected in favour of
  Ferruzzi's lower bid.
      Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said ""Amylum
  should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right
  offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case
  of the acquisition of CPC's European business.""
      Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern
  himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under
  study, he added.
      Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the
  European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC
  business, Gardini said: ""We do not exclude having minority
  partners in the CPC business."" He declined to elaborate.

  GAF Corp said it has made an all
  cash merger proposal to Borg-Warner Corp at 46 dlrs per share
  for all the company's common stock.
      Following a meeting yesterday with Borg-Warner officials
  and investment bankers, GAF said, it is today delivering a
  letter to the Borg-Warner board outling the terms of the
  proposal that would be made by tender offer, pursuant to a
  mutually acceptable merger agreement to be approved by the
  Borg-Warner board and conditioned on that board's
  recommendation of the tender offer and merger.
      GAF, in its letter, stated it intends to finance the
  proposed acquisition entirely with its own funds and bank
  borrowings under a syndicated bank loan from a group of banks
  led by Chase Manhattan Corp's &lt;CMB> Chase Manhattan Bank.
      Last week, GAF increased its ownership of Borg-Warner
  shares to 19.9 pct of those outstanding Minstar Inc &lt;MNST> sold
  its 12.4 pct holding.
      GAF emphasized ""the amicable nature of the proposed
  transaction,"" which it characterized as a partnership.
      GAF said it wanted to discuss with the Borg-Warner board 
  key roles for Borg-Warner's senior management in the new
  organization, board representation for Borg-Warner directors on
  a newly constituted board, and a company name change.
      GAF said it will be filing an amendment to its 13-D with
  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
      Borg-Warner has about 85.6 mln common shares outstanding.
      Minstar chairman Irwin L. Jacobs sold his stake after
  Borg-Warner after the company failed to respond to his
  mid-February offer for a negotiated agreement at a minimum
  price of 44 dlrs a share.
      In November, Jacobs had offered to enter into acquisition

  China's application to join the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by

  top European Community official said.
      Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the
  European Communities, told a news conference that China's
  application would involve long and difficult negotiations.
      China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in
  February presented a memorandum backing its application, which
  De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be
  presented to China.
      ""After China, other important state-trading countries
  including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.
  China's application could be considered a test case,"" he said.
      He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but
  others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.
      Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy
  entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and
  the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy
  without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.
      De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese
  economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current
  Socialist GATT members.
      On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange
  shortage would force China to import less this year and next
  than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment
  and capital.

  today signed an agreement to open a European Community

11487,"CHIRAC, REAGAN DISCUSS ARMS CONTROL, TRADE
  French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
  opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on
  superpower arms control moves and trade issues.
      French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to
  present France's concern that the United States might ignore
  European security interests in any accord with Moscow on
  removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.
      But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not
  agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give
  the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats
  said.
      France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles
  from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in
  other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,
  conventional forces and chemical weapons.
      Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position
  saying: ""Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should
  mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.""
      Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a
  dispute between two leading research institutes over patent
  rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.
      In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur
  Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of
  Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from
  the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight
  against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
      ""This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American
  cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join
  their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of
  speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,"" Reagan
  said at the signing ceremony. 
      He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80
  per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.
      The foundation would also raise private funds and would
  donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less
  developed countries. 
      Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the
  United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House
  East Room, with Reagan describing France as ""America's oldest
  ally in war and peace."" 
      ""I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the
  same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers
  which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new
  diseases and drugs,"" Chirac replied.
      But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on
  over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise
  in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. 
      A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to
  sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of
  lessening surplus stocks.
      Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first
  proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,
  during his two-day visit to Washington.
      The U.S. official described the idea as a ""grain producers'
  OPEC"" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
  Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan
  administration's desire to lessen government intervention in
  trade.

11490,"CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER
  Canada's airline industry, shaken up by
  a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for
  government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive
  for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.
      ""Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,""
  said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.
  ""Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.""
      The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr
  takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but
  cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week
  as Canadian Airlines International Ltd.
      Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the
  6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's
  50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine
  pct.
      Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and
  cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true
  potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four
  decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific
  Ltd.
      They said CP Air's management style had been not much
  different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because
  neither airline was held accountable to its owners.
      ""Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these
  two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither
  seemed that concerned about the bottom line,"" said Bradley.
      ""But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very
  conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air
  Canada is on the verge of going that way,"" he said.
      CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than
  profits, was ""a perennial money-loser,"" analyst Wilfred Hahn of
  Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report.
      Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated
  long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its
  losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.
      Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this
  year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on
  revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more
  than 2 billion dlrs.
      Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to
  the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of
  increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more
  attention to finances, analysts said.
      It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit ""in
  excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs"" for 1986. However, this profit
  recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that
  all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.
      Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,
  attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in
  Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.
      For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air
  traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from
  cost-cutting and careful spending.
      Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said
  institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their
  portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new
  competition makes profit growth less certain.
      ""The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At
  one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody
  else's,"" Friend said.
      Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline
  shares for at least a year.
      Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a
  public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes
  without setting off a political storm.
      It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary
  updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.
      Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,
  already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of
  a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
      Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered
  six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would
  soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the
  Boeing Co.
      Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,
  needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without
  hurting profits.
      Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian
  Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8
  mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.

  A. William Reynolds, chairman and
  chief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to
  announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile
  tender within a week.
      Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the
  tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the
  group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate
  GenCorp while ""we have had only 10 days to respond.""
      Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal
  challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York
  City market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.
      Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain
  of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to
  sell the station to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs.
      Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were
  dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has
  already approved the station's sale.
      Money from the sale of the station will play a role in
  helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored
  by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds
  said. He provided no other details.
      Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief
  financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting,
  which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About
  300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.
      Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the
  meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.
      Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members
  have been telling him ""Bill, just don't pay greenmail"" to end
  the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority
  shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds
  said he considers it a ""repugnant device.""
      Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.
  Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a
  large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.
  Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to ""stiffen
  the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail.""
      Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they
  are open to negotiations with GenCorp.
      Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the
  event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted
  ""we're developing alternatives that would not result in a
  change in control.""
      Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any
  proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, ""We
  know the company, we know the values and we know the
  opportunities better than any outside group.""
      In response to a question about whether any units are up
  for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.

  Nelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would become
  profitable.
      Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, would
  increase Avery's operating earnings but that associated
  acquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profits
  for some time.
      At the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in the
  authorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.
      In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported a
  loss of 489,000 dlrs. The company has changed its fiscal year
  to end Sept 30.
      The increase in common shares would cover, among other
  things, the exercise of Triangle Industries Inc's &lt;TRI> and
  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's warrants issued in relation to
  Avery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical late last
  year.

11498,"TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN
  The threatened trade war between the
  United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that
  economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.
      But they are not so sure if that would be a brief
  corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices
  mark the start of a ""bear"" market.
      ""It's the billion dollar question,"" said Richard O'Brien,
  economist at American Express International Bank in London.
      Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has
  poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded
  a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of
  any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the
  Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the
  dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it
  fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of
  improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or
  because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,
  may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget
  deficit.
     And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will
  have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the
  gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.
  Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The
  subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls
  on the world stock markets.
      ""A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,""
  said O'Brien. ""Now, it is much less certain.""
      Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming
  economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in
  the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and
  huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.
      Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith
  Barney Harris Upham said  ""We're still in a bull market,"" adding
  that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and ""The
  bear usually strikes slowly.""
      Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in
  London, said the huge sums of money going through the world
  financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.
      Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in
  non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very
  difficult to see where else they can put their money than in
  U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,
  according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi
  Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.
      He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now
  to the French franc and West German mark.
      In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and
  the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.

  Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously
  resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the
  Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,
  either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.
      Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF
  through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's
  stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.
      Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will
  stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can
  add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.
      ""It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)
  Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is
  now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want
  to remain independent,"" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.
      Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation
  for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,
  Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln
  Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by
  9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.
      Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no
  steps toward a transaction.
      ""Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for
  the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate
  battles I've seen,"" said one analyst.
      The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of
  breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market
  price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they
  think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.
      Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on
  its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.
      Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up
  with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials
  company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an
  unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited
  from that company's restructuring.
      ""Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate
  offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of
  between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a
  46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I
  personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per
  share,"" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.
      Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a
  restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and
  Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James
  Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and
  carried out a wider share repurchase.
      Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is
  seeking ""greenmail,"" or the repurchase of his stock by the
  company at a premium.
      Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with
  financing the transaction.
      Previously associated with ""junk bond"" experts, Drexel
  Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner
  takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender
  offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner
  board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the
  tender offer and merger.
      Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a
  merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees
  since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,
  believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay
  debt from the transaction.
      GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.
     ""I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the
  level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values
  substantially,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.
      He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the
  company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's
  current holdings.
      Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,
  which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.
  Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.
      The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office
  equipment and appliances. ""Borg has half the market in the U.S.
  and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,""
  Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> and
  Monsanto Corp &lt;MTC>, he said.
      Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a
  protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards. It also has an information services business,
  and is trying to sell its financial services business.
      Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on
  revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,
  earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per
  share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.
      GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln
  from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a
  special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union
  Carbide shares.

  President Reagan has reaffirmed his

  telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French
  official expressed concern about the rising tide of
  protectionist sentiment in the United States.
      Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the

  ""do not believe this will result in a trade war.""

      ""We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a trade

  over unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,
  but ""I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out.""
      Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.
      He also said he did not think there would be a trade war
  with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the
  United States to risk such a war.
      ""Those fears are unfounded,"" he said.
      He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the
  securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear
  of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.
      Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the
  value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some
  effect.
      Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop
  in the market to trade sanctions were ""barking up the wrong
  tree.""
      He said the market observers will realize this shortly.
      Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything
  about the market or the exchange rate of the dollar.

  Republican members of the House
  Agriculture Committee said they will propose amendments
  tomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for the
  export enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expanding
  the scope of the program.
      At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they would
  propose expanding EEP to include all countries ""willing to
  purchase additional commodities at reasonable prices.""
      In addition, the Congressmen said they would propose
  extending the life of EEP to five years from the current three
  years and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billion
  dlrs from 1.5 billion at present.
      The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting
  amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.
      Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture Secretary
  Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said they
  favor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of an
  across-the-board program which they termed too costly.
      The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer an
  amendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. Agriculture
  Department to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at the
  market value, rather than the cost of acquisition.
      But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market value
  accounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoid
  hitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.
      Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mln
  dlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Using
  acquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher.

      Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and

  previous year.
      ""We were looking for 1.15 dlrs,"" said an analyst at a major

  of the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its
  Secaucus, N.J. distribution center.

  Ames. ""We do not have hard evidence we are still putting things

      He said it would take several weeks for the company to

      He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it
  was the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in

  The U.S. Agriculture Department said

      USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told the Senate

  billed DOT 12 mln dlrs, and that interest on that amount and an
  additional charge would begin accruing April 1.
      USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator Thomas

      Sims said the agencies were near to reaching a memorandum

  the cargo preference costs.
      Under the 1985 bill, the percentage of food aid shipments
  carried on U.S. vessels was to increase gradually over three

11637,"1ST CENTRAL FINANCIAL &lt;FCC> SEES HIGHER EARNINGS
  First Central Financial Corp said it
  expects earnings to rise significantly in 1987 and said it is
  actively seeking an acquisition.
      The property and casualty insurance company's chairman and
  chief executive officer, Martin J. Simon, told Reuters in an
  interview that he expects earnings of 33 cts a share in 1987
  compared with 25 cts a year ago.
      He said, ""the company currently has the sufficient momentum
  to achieve those earnings and the successful completion of
  licensing applications to operate in Pennsylvania, Delaware,
  Connecticut and Ohio should fuel our earnings.""
      The company is currently licenced to operate only in New
  York state.
      Simon estimated that the company would earn seven cts a
  share in the first quarter compared to three cts in the same
  quarter a year ago, and eight cts a share in the second quarter
  compared to five cts earned in 1986. He expects the company to
  earn nine cts a share for each of the final two quarters of
  1987.
      In addition, Simon said, First Central Financial ""is
  actively looking for, and has several acquisition brokers
  looking for a small life insurance company to acquire.""
      He said the acquisition should be in the 10 mln dlr range
  and will be part of a strategy of expanding the company into a
  ""wide spectrum of insurance services."" No specific company has
  been targeted as yet, ""but I would like to make my first
  acquisition in 1987,"" he said.
      He said First Central Financial would not itself be an easy
  takeover target. It wants to remain independent, he said, and
  has implemented a staggered board of directors system. In
  addition, Simon, the company's biggest shareholder, holds about
  960,000 of the 6.2 mln ouitstanding shares.

11639,"IMPERIAL OIL &lt;IMO.A> IN TALKS WITH SUPPLIERS
  Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct-owned by Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliers
  concerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta's
  shut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented on
  June 1, a company spokesman said.
      ""From our point of view, it's a question of entering into
  negotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes to
  contracts to reflect the changes that are going to take place
  on June 1,"" spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to a
  query.
      Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended
  its oil supply contracts, Cote said: ""It's not a question of
  cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point.""
      On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
  will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system,
  regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a
  trial basis to the end of 1987.
      Under the new system, producers and refiners will be
  allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered
  under purchase contracts.
      Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of
  oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.
      ""We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and
  we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has
  been finalized,"" Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary
  Strong said.
      Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a
  reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast
  demand for its refineries, Strong said.
      ""We have to know what they have and how that relates to what
  we need in total,"" he said.
      Strong said figures on the amount of crude production
  Imperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediately
  available.

  GAF Corp chairman Samuel Heyman told

  if GAF's 46 dlr-per-share offer to acquire Borg-Warner is
  successful.
      ""We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement,"" Heyman
  said, following a speech at the American Institute of Chemical
  Engineers annual meeting. ""We don't have any particular changes
  in mind.""
      Earlier today, GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offer
  was presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-based
  company.
      Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of the
  company for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to
  19.9 pct.
      In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire Union
  Carbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed an
  interest in acquiring a chemical company that would complement
  its own chemical business.
      When asked whether GAF would consider selling the
  non-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer is
  accepted, Heyman declined to comment.
      He also refused to say whether GAF would consider
  increasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if the
  initial proposal is rejected.
      Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer to
  Borg-Warner to be a friendly one.
      ""We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warner
  management and good for its shareholders,"" Heyman said.
       In his speech, Heyman said he feared too many chemical
  companies were attempting to specialize in the same high margin
  niche products.
      He said they were turning their backs on core commodity
  chemical businesses. 
      Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total of
  seven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past two
  years to trim balance sheets.
      He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry, which
  reported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits, would see
  a 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasing
  exports, cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.

  Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier
  reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier
  profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write
  downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in
  deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.
      The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign
  exchange losses, the company said.
      ""The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses
  much of the progress the company has made in the two previous
  years,"" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.
      ""But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little
  bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,"" chairman
  Macdonald said.
      ""It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the
  company's assets in today's economic environment, and the
  absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders
  on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued
  existence,"" he added.
      Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for
  restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.
      Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated
  foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the
  uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.
      Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining
  period of the loans to which they apply, it said.
      Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter
  reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20
  billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of
  305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a
  charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in
  the third quarter.
      Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge
  resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full
  cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of
  Chartered Accountants.
      The company said it previously determined a write down of
  conventional oil and gas properties was not required at
  September 30, under the previous method of calculating the
  limitation of oil and gas values.
      Dome said the most significant accounting change under the
  new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in
  calculations instead of escalating price forecasts.
      Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude
  the company from making an accurate estimate of future
  financing costs, which are used in the new accounting
  calculations, it said.
      As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10
  pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially
  conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities
  and Exchange Commission, the company said.
      Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural
  gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71
  billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.
      Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas
  operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion
  dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.
      Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of
  Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also
  contributed to the decline, it said.
      Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79
  pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago
  542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0
  mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.
      Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained
  at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and
  improvements in productivity.
      Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of
  lower domestic and export sales, it said.
      Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled

  Pacific Gas and Electric Co said
  it expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,
  reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to
  change the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
  Plant revenues.
      The accounting change will not affect the company's cash
  position and the company intends to continue paying its
  dividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.
      Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or
  2.60 dlrs per share.
      Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by
  delays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities
  Commission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate
  relief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing
  units one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.
      It said the commission is currently allowing the company to
  recover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.
      As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month
  as deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been
  included in current income.
      But the accounting change, effective January 1, will
  reflect only cash received through interim rates approved by
  the commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.
      It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public
  Staff Division's report which will recommend how much of the
  5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to
  recover in rates.
      The company further stated that it is confident it will
  receive an objective review of the facts.
      It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.
      Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power
  units in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one
  went into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in

  The surge in currency futures since
  Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed
  tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the
  coming week, financial analysts said.
      ""The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it
  to last a little longer,"" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst
  with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co.
      Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some
  momentum today, is likely to continue, he said.
      Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the
  advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said,
  even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the
  Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention.
      Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6
  nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his
  refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note
  of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said.
      Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner
  said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of
  their commitment to the Paris accord.
      ""I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the
  scenes,"" Horner said.
      Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will
  firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures.
      ""Coordinated, punishing intervention"" by the central banks
  -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has
  only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to
  Horner.
      ""I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans
  (currencies),"" he said.
       On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which
  set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract,
  is at 0.007050, Horner said.
      Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to
  peak.
      ""The basic trend in the currencies is higher,"" said Anne
  Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers
  Inc. ""The market wants to take the dollar lower.""
      Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a
  G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the
  International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price
  activity the remainder of the week, Mills said.
      In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively
  healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and
  factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role
  in coming sessions, the analysts said.
      Friday's employment statistics in particular will be
  closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of
  250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar.

11746,"ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE
  Quarter-point prime rate increases to
  7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be
  followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of
  the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.
      ""Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
  prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but
  no rush is likely,"" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.
      Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by
  Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.
      McCulley said that once the spread between three-month
  certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than
  1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime
  rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.
      However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they
  see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near
  term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to
  follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,
  the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks
  lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount
  rate increase in April of that year.
      Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since
  last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct
  shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the
  current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.
      ""The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There
  should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2
  pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G.
  Lanston and Co.
      Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's
  meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may
  well foster higher interest rates soon.
      Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy
  change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
  pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat
  up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.
      ""The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to
  tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,"" said Joseph
  Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.
      In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the
  Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by
  offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for
  its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a ""pass.""
      ""The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy
  change,"" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter
  Reynolds Inc. 
      She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
  prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153
  basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not
  really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
  increase.
      The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise
  ""may have been less a response to interest rates than an
  attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.""
      Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to
  developing countries, large money center banks with heavy
  exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in
  an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.
      The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money
  to one another could help determine how many banks match the
  higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.
      In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of
  funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal
  funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly
  6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  
      The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting
  demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the
  close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five
  and 6-3/4 pct.
      Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds
  rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the
  6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,
  banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.
      But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many
  that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to
  help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.

  First City Bancorp of Texas, which lost
  a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it
  expected operating losses to continue ""for the foreseeable
  future"" as it continues to search for additional capital or a
  merger partner.
      The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received
  a qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.
  The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City
  eventually obtaining additional capital.
      ""The company believes that in order to address its
  long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of
  operations, it will ultimately need several hundred million
  dollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more
  strongly capitalized entity,"" First City said in a note to its
  financial statements included in the annual report.
      ""Management believes that sufficient resources should be
  available to cover interim capital concerns while additional
  capital is being sought,"" the bank said.
      To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell
  or mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions
  to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of
  its member banks.
      ""The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less
  than in 1986,"" First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter
  included in the annual report. ""However, the ultimate return to
  satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the
  successful resolution of the related problems of credit
  quality, funding and the eventual need for substantial
  additional capital.""
      First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a
  credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of
  First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would
  be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid
  default.
      The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants
  last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120
  mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.
      Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios
  exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,
  First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First
  City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of
  5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.
      Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate
  prices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs
  last year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than
  doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of
  1986.
      First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total
  energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion
  dlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs ""should
  be more modest."" The amount represented 15 pct of First City's
  total loans.
      In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets
  nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.
  Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine
  pct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount
  could go higher.
      ""The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate
  market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio
  so long as the regional recession persists,"" First City said.
  ""Because the carrying value of many of these loans is
  collateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of
  the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of
  real estate-related chargeoffs.""

11753,"U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX
  The complex task of wielding control
  over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global
  economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the
  newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.
      Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the
  making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much
  greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert
  Heller, who joined the board last August.
      He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but
  argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were
  adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the
  volatility of exchange rates.
      Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of
  commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.
      His idea, which many conservative economists find
  appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in
  recent years by President Reagan.
      It would complement the present system of opening or
  closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,
  key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of
  the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to
  changes in interest rates and affect economic activity
  directly.
      Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept
  is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary
  policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid
  base.
      ""What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can
  serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary
  purposes,"" says Heller.
      In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States
  went off the gold standard because the global economy had
  vastly outstripped gold supplies.
      A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of
  hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest
  producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.
      The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early
  1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.
      But the current system of floating currencies in which
  currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the
  monetary system, is also being widely questioned.
      Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a
  formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when
  currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are
  major problems with this also.
      For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries
  might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be
  detrimental to their own domestic economy.
      Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can
  make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree
  with the fundamental judgement.
      The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference
  to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them
  cope with their overpowering debt problems.
      Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's
  chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called
  Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a
  forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other
  economic matters.
     He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,
  France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind
  closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public
  posturing.
     The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a
  profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and
  international exchange rates.
      As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major
  commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together
  and prices would be measured on a regular basis.
      ""In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might
  be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary
  policy might be eased,"" he says.
      He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction
  markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a
  virtually continuous basis.
      Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and
  traded on a world-wide basis, so ""that an index has a relevance
  for the entire world,"" he says.
      In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the
  production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all
  production processes.
      ""Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive
  indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,
  the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in
  making their monetary policy decisions,"" he says.
      However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity
  such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by
  the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.
      He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow
  monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity
  to the rest of the system and to other commodities.

11763,"EMERY AIR &lt;EAF> TO BID FOR PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> 
  Emery Air Freight Corp said it
  plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83
  pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp.
      The company said the tender offer is the first step in a
  plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.
      Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40
  dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining
  Purolator share outstanding.
      On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share
  leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton
  LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.
      Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger
  discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the
  management-led buyout offer.
      In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,
  Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still
  prefer to negotiate with Purolator.
      But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout
  group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited
  tender offer of its own.
      Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on
  April 28, unless extended.
      The company said conditions of the offer include the
  receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares
  outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its
  share purchase rights plan.
      Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the
  previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.
      Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty
  Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for
  the tender offer.
      It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in
  the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,
  payable twice a year.
      For the first three years after the notes are issued,
  interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in
  additional notes, Emery said.
      It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption
  for one year after they are issued.
      Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit
  of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's
  management would continue with the company.
      ""We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit
  with each other and that the combination will enable each of us
  to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges
  of the future,"" Emery's chairman said in his letter.
      He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial
  turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.
      Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for
  comment on the offer, which was released several hours after
  the stock market had closed.
      Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.

11768,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND
  ""If we go on using up
  farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in
  20 years to grow grain on.""
      Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on
  the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it
  tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same
  time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.
      China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,
  but only one seventh of its land is arable.
      Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into
  a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in
  1986.
      But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which
  has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for
  factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.
      Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of
  its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller
  amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during
  the two years.
      ""We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the
  industrialisation began,"" official Xu said. ""Since then, nearly
  all the families in the county have built new homes and many
  factories have gone up.""
      ""Last year we lost land to a new railway line,"" Xu said. But
  land losses in future should fall because nearly all families
  already have new houses, she added.
      The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the
  Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that
  China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land
  for the first time this year.
      ""The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,
  wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,"" said
  an article in the official press explaining the new measures.
      ""It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,"" it
  said. ""China has a large population and its land resources are
  badly deficient.""
      An official of the Shanghai city government said county
  authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of
  arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must
  be approved by the city government.
     The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its
  efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The
  prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making
  it more profitable for them to grow other crops.
      To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser
  and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to
  buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to
  China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise
  grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.
      Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the
  problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.
      Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the
  eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too
  much to the demands of ""selfish city people"" and could raise city
  grain prices without any problem.
      But the government has ruled out a price rise. ""Raising the
  price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social
  stability,"" said a China Daily editorial this month.
      The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the
  long term. ""We must be very careful. We have a very large
  population which is used to price stability and will object to
  price rises,"" he said. ""The problem is how to do it.""
      The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might
  also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with
  grain and consumed by city residents.
      In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate
  investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.
      The official press has reported that farmers fear farm
  policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into
  building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.
      Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign
  contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,
  but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.
      ""As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at
  the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the
  future,"" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.
      Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to
  use the land but not own it. For most of the period of
  Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where
  there was little room for individual initiative.
      ""New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency
  of government policies and make them interested in long-term
  investment,"" the newspaper said.

  Taiwan's imports in the second quarter of
  1987 are expected to rise to 7.75 billion U.S. Dlrs from 5.82
  billion a year earlier and from 6.95 billion in the first
  quarter of this year, the statistics department said.
      A department official attributed the increase to growing
  domestic investment by the private and public sectors. It is
  expected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion a
  year earlier and 3.41 billion during the first quarter.
      Taiwan's exports in the April-June quarter are expected to
  rise to 12.03 billion U.S. Dlrs from 9.63 billion a year
  earlier and 11.28 billion in the first quarter.

  from 3.81 billion a year earlier. It was 4.33 billion in the

11773,"COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR
  Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management
  board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present
  viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be
  lower than in 1986.
      In the first two months of the year, partial operating
  profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account -
  declined, he said, without giving details.
      The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of
  1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the
  quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.
  By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.
      German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp
  said last year the figure for the first time had topped one
  billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was
  around 50 pct higher than this.
      Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, ""we were able to raise the
  full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of
  1985 because own account profits increased slightly.""
      He gave no concrete details but added that in January and
  February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop
  in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the
  partial operating figure.
      The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in
  future, developing, for example, more into investment banking,
  keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening
  expenditures on fixed assets.
      Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had
  been a strong growth in business volume.
      Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2
  billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.
      Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15
  billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher
  still if currency relationships had remained unchanged.
      In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in
  the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56
  pct despite pressure on credit rates.
      The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a
  quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost
  exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.
      Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more
  than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct
  to more than 650 mln.
      As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose
  by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.
      Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year
  from 233 mln in 1985.
      Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a ""high
  two-figure million"" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG
  &lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter's
  majority stake purchase booked last year.
      The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in
  credit business against profits from securities trading and
  earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior
  years, to its full extent.
      Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the
  largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual
  write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of
  problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of
  credit exposure to provisions improved further.
      Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to
  problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into
  dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.
      ""This means that no open currency positions exist any longer
  on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual
  default,"" he added.
      Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the
  last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is
  better armed than it was against payment problems.
      All banks had significantly strengthened their capital
  base, most European banks had made considerable provisions
  against bad debts while goverments and central banks were
  better prepared for unforseen difficulties.
      He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new
  approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of
  interest in direct investment via an equity participation in
  Latin America, particularly from West German firms.

  Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise

  yesterday, dealers said.
      They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at

11831,"INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE
  The Indian Finance Ministry's
  announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's
  interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture
  by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.
      The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial
  bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct
  by one percentage point.
      New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also
  include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on
  deposits of two years or more but less than five.
      Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct
  interest have been abolished.
      Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the
  government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help
  improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.
      There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits
  by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create
  the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity
  shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.
      A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due
  to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.
      Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,
  opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing
  of 1,012.50 rupees.
      A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now
  to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the
  Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5
  pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.
      ""But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the
  rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks
  pay for deposits of similar maturity,"" a merchant banker said.

  The prospect that other banks will

  markets today, economists said.
      Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days
  of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by
  announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4
  pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
      Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar
  - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the
  news.
      Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the
  Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.
      Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears
  of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but
  economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose
  policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this
  week, is already tightening its grip on credit.

  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
  O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction
  blocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL> Airlines
  Inc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL>, the Court said.
      O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of
  the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had
  blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation
  had been settled by arbitration.
      A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of
  the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,
  to go through as planned later today.
      The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each
  of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a
  particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to
  provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.
      The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of
  Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger
  for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes
  belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.
      ""Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,""
  Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late
  last night. ""There was really very little that remained to be
  done.""
      The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been
  filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport
  Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill
  a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took
  place.
      The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
  enforced in a takeover by a larger company.
      After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials
  last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees
  should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new
  Delta outfits.
      Delta announced last September that it was purchasing
  Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has
  been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western
  name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.
      At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to
  represent Western employees after the integration of the two
  airlines.
      While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are
  unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.
      Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts
  with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the
  Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be
  ""extinguished"" after today.

      The company said the move will reduce Asian overhead and a

  &lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a
  19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
  report improved results in future earnings periods.
      ""Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
  highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
  a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
  non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
  periods ahead,"" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
      The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
  ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
  ago.
      Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
  substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
  international operations remains weak, reflecting
  resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
  borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
  activities.
      The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
  mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
  earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
  from 42 mln dlrs last year.
      Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
  income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
  from international investment banking as well as a significant
  loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
      Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
  year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
  deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
  lower securities commissions from international investment bank
  operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
      The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
  98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
  consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

  Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
  De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world

      De Croo said at a news conference ""if you limit textile
  imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe.""
      And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.
      Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was
  vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to
  protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation
  U.S. trading partners.
      A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a
  Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President
  weakened by the Iran scandal.
      De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and
  Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, ""the only way we
  could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more
  retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems.""
      He said if a textile bill was enacted, ""we will impose taxes
  on a lot of American products.""  He said ""it would be stupid. We
  have to avoid that.""
      He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of
  its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with
  EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted 
  shipments of Asian textiles.
      De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve
  EC trade issues, saying ""each time we come in contact, it a
  conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West.""
      He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross
  the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.

  House Ways and Means Committee
  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation
  to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
      In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press
  Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation
  will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
      But he warned that his ""conciliatory message"" on the trade
  bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn
  other countries their access to the American market would be
  curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
      ""Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a
  smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,""
  Rostenkowski said.
      ""It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied
  us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the
  American market,"" he added.
      However, he said there would likely be changes in the
  market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House
  last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for
  foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face
  a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.

      Charles Blackburn, president and chief executive officer of
  Diamond Shamrock and the new company, which will emphasize

  in 1986."" He declined to say how much better.
      In 1986 Diamond Shamrock reported a loss of 115.6 mln dlrs
  on total revenues of 2.543 billion dlrs. Exploration and
  production lost 18.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 593.5 mln dlrs.

  soon-to-be chief executive of the spin-off Diamond Shamrock
  Refining and Marketing Co, said, ""Refining and marketing is a
  margin business. The margins will return and this will be a
  better year than 1986.""
      In 1986, refining and marketing showed operating profits of
  40.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.636 billion dlrs.
      ""We are also expecting to be in the black in the first
  quarter (1987),"" Heminghaus added. In the first quarter of 1986,

  Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively
  traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected
  earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
  micrographics company.
      Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
  trading as high as seven earlier.
      Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
  Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
  doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
  forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
  micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.
      ""The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
  as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX,"" Harlow said.
  ""Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
  integrate the company in the second half.""
      Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
  integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
      A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
  its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
  how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
  DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
  Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
      Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
  that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
  DatagraphiX. ""The estimates on the street narrow it down to
  between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs,"" Harlow added.
      Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
  its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
  a share.
      In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts

12084,"AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT
  Calls for a cut in Austrian interest
  rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided
  over the issue.
      Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und
  Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a
  percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes
  Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> told
  Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.
      Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in
  lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors
  by a quarter point had been insufficient.
      The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of
  its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a
  similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and
  deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.
      Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche
  Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a
  point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.
      Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A
  widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German
  credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth
  this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.
      Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der
  oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for
  lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain
  unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,
  particularly when compared with other West European countries.
      But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische
  Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless
  West German rates came down first.
      Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates
  alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming
  opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.

  Export Credits Guarantee Department has
  named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's
  Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17
  years, to the post of executive director, a department
  spokesman said.
      Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.
      A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt
  to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent
  years.
      Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top
  convern, adding that the department may have to compete more
  aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar
  services.
      The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,
  1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7
  billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt
  to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.
      Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among
  his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser
  developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
      The agency will have to review its policies on insuring
  export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,
  he said. ""Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of
  thing we want to take a look at.""
      ""You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in
  a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,""
  Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will
  strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance
  recipients.
      He noted that certain countries have already been removed

  Conrac Corp, whose board has
  rejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries
  Inc &lt;IV>, said it is exploring alternatives such as a
  restructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company.
       In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and
  legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV
  offer, which it said it considers inadequate.
      The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,
  leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another
  company, Conrac said.
      Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives at
  special meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision on
  whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on ""the
  future actions of Mark IV"" and its unsolicitied tender offer.
      Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored
  could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said.
      Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the
  terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it
  becomes final, the company said.
      The board also took other defensive steps, including
  granting severance agreements to some officers, it said.
      At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a
  provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all
  classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders
  meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to
  remove directors without cause, the company said.
      The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it
  planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a
  special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority
  of the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.
      Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given
  severance agreements, or ""golden parachutes,"" it said.
      Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get
  a cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906
  dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the
  company, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the
  company's voting stock, Conrac said.
      Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph
  O'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get
  one-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in
  control. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing.
      The executives would also get cash settlements of options
  plans and continuation of insurance and other benefits.

      E.F. Hutton lbo inc said its wholly owned PC Acquisition

  Emery Air Freight Corp topped a
  leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40
  mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer
  may surface.
      Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over
  Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share
  or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc.
      Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for
  Purolator exceeded their expectations.
      Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover
  values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share
  range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be
  taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
      Analysts today would not venture to say whether another
  offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the
  belief that the bidding could go higher.
      ""They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.
  Emery has shown the courage to go forth,"" said one arbitrager,
  who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as
  bidders.
      ""It makes sense,"" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.
  But ""It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a
  100 pct of the synergies.""
      Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in
  the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies
  and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's
  profitability.
      Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival
  United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package
  delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47
  pct of the market.
      Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would
  have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery
  business.
      ""This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight
  (delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,""
  said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.
      Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and
  its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.
      E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,
  but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on
  its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.
      One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely
  Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a
  company outside the package delivery industry would want to
  outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same 
  synergies as a courier company.
      Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some
  of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary,
  speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.
      The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator
  board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he
  believed a better offer could be made by another entity.
      A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had
  no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined
  up for Purolator.
      Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question
  by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted
  to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.
  Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.
      Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could
  be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to
  keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279
  mln dlr ""bridge"" loan that would later be replaced with other
  debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.
      Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n
  its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its
  279 mln dlr loan.
      Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln
  dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in
  revenues.

      The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user

      A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the
  Canadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for a
  substantial cut in credit card rates ""was a factor"" in the
  move, but he would not elaborate.
      Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had

  Rumors that New York investor Asher
  Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism
  about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit
  pending with Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> sent Polaroid's stock
  higher, traders said.
      Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2.
      ""Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in
  Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced
  today,"" one trader said.
      Edelman had no comment on the rumors.
      A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been
  contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the
  Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the
  company.
      ""There is some hope among investors that there will some
  progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent
  infringement suit with Kodak,"" analyst Michael Ellmann of
  Wertheim and Co said.
      Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be
  set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.
      The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that
  Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In
  October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or
  film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman
  said.
      Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any
  progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.
      Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today
  from some optimism concerning new products the company is
  currently working on.
      ""Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company
  executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new
  product spurred some speculation about their products,"" he
  said. ""I am speculating that the new product could be an
  electronic still camera,"" referring to a camera that records
  its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

  House Ways and Means Committee

      He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
  number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
  a tax increase to help balance the budget.
      However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
  enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
      There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the

12394,"DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987
  Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen a
  slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,
  management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.
      Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the
  year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak
  German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and
  trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency
  dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.
      Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78
  billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance
  sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.
      Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the
  former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one
  billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's
  own account, not included in partial operating profits.
      Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a
  subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest
  surplus in a section current earnings from securities and
  participations.
      In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from
  1.45 billion.
      As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.
      But it said that total operating profits, including own
  account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick
  transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the
  parent bank.
      Banking analysts said this put group total operating
  profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank
  operating profits at over five billion marks.
      Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings
  from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its
  unchanged 12 mark dividend.
      The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself
  because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,
  and developments so far this year showed that was correct,
  Christians said.
      West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are
  sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent
  years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.
      The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a
  high level of risk provision, Christians said.
      Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in
  1986 from 765 mln in 1985.
      Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily
  reflect the full amount of risk provisions.
      Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said
  Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen
  to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985
  because of the fall in the dollar.
      He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of
  such problem country debt had been written off.
      Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of ""other
  securities,"" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the
  parent bank.
      Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due
  to its increased activity in international share placements,
  with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international
  placement last year remaining on its books.
      Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to
  place these shares and conclude the original placement.

  Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board
  joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.
      Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from
  Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with
  Creditanstalt.
      Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of
  Lloyds Bank plc &lt;LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.
      Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent
  capital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no
  plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.
      &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was
  acquired from Bankamerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> late last year, would be
  consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of
  Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.
  Wilhelm Christians said.
      Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High
  Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the
  balance sheet section ""participations,"" Christians said.
      But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these
  non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active
  participation.
      Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks
  in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise
  to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.
      Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance
  sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in
  a separate holding company.

12397,"SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH
  Singapore's major banks are
  diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from
  loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.
      The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union Bank
  Ltd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese Banking
  Corporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.
      The shift towards securitisation has been helped by
  volatile financial markets which have developed hedging
  facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk
  management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.
      Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see
  limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are
  switching from term lending to major growth areas such as
  stockbroking and fee based income, he said.
      Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being
  granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now
  moving into the new government securities market and the Stock
  Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.
      One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the
  Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity
  market in Singapore.
      Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has
  increased business transactions and provided long term growth
  for the market. The banks are not competition for individual
  stockbroking firms because of the increased business they
  generate, he added.
      Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand
  equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because
  of the increasing ability of foreign and local market
  participants to absorb new issues.
      Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of
  the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to
  launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors
  seeking capital growth through a diversified international
  portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the
  emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.
      &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the
  Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong
  Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.
      Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in
  Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be
  forced to provide fund management services for major clients
  seeking better returns, he said.
      Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major
  banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from
  treasury and investment banking activities.
      They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese
  and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct
  against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.
      Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40
  mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.
      The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in
  1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by
  &lt;National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary
  of the bank, they said.

  A Japanese businessman announced plans for
  a new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable and
  Wireless Plc would be a core company.
      However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of
  Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not
  specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.
      ""The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,""
  Watanabe said in a statement. ""The actual percentage of
  shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies.""
      He said the eight core companies will provide directors for
  the firm.
      ""The new company shall immediately set to work on the
  feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,""
  Watanabe said.
      Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,
  one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against
  &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan's
  overseas telephone business.
      The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants
  only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.
      A British source, who declined to be identified further,
  said the proposals could open the door to further talks between
  C and W &lt;CAWL.L> and the other firms involved.
      C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which
  would have given it a five pct share in the new
  telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct
  stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake
  in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.
      The British source said the decision not to specify the
  exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door
  open for further discussion.
      ""It's probably a sensible approach on their part,"" the
  British source told reuters.
      C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a
  new cable between Japan and the U.S.
      The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with
  British government sources threatening retaliatory action
  against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices
  against foreign firms.
      The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain
  would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities
  companies operating in London.
      The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,
  saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.
      Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,
  Watanabe said, ""They will not be core companies but if they wish
  they could participate."" Under the Japanese law, total foreign
  participation would be limited to one-third.
      ""It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has
  the support of many influential backers and work within this
  for the realization of their ideas,"" Watanabe told reporters.
      The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>, Mitsui
  and Co &lt;MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T>, Matsushita Electric
  Industrial Co &lt;MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co

  Chemicals group Bayer
  AG &lt;BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987
  after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.
      The company said that this was despite the mark's further
  strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and
  despite an increase in competitive pressure.
      ""The further progress of our business will depend largely on
  the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on
  the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy
  costs.
      Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion
  marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15
  billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72
  billion from 1.62 billion.
      The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of
  the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985
  results, up one mark from a year earlier.
      Bayer said that world group operating profit declined
  slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed
  a further improvement.
      Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to
  40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly
  the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.
      Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought
  pressure on selling prices, it added.
      In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against
  1985, the company said without giving details.
      ""The western Europe, North America and Far East regions
  developed well in local currency, but here too the translation
  of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,
  especially in the case of North America,"" it said.
      Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in
  1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.
      Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,
  resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined
  with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset
  falling prices and cost increases in other areas.
      The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower
  extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.
  Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw
  materials all developed well, it said.
      Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world
  group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three
  months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.
      Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct
  to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and
  foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower.

  &lt;San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and &lt;United
  Coconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a
  disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a
  government panel that controls the sequestered shares said.
      Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
  Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126
  pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.
      ""It looks good,"" Diaz said. But he added several issues,
  including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,
  had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the
  sale.
      The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted
  SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the
  UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were
  actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of
  former President Ferdinand Marcos.
      Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when
  he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24
  mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.
      ""The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are
  owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,"" Diaz said. ""Naturally we do
  not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.""
      PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down
  payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary
  Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.
      The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be
  forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to
  fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally
  negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.
      PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and
  beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln ""B"" class shares
  from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a
  price of 150 pesos per share.
      The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso
  transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500
  mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred
  shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected
  dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to
  UCPB-controlled trading companies.
      The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share
  made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15
  pct stock dividend declared in June last year.
      A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met
  today to discuss the proposed compromise.
      The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board
  meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.
      President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to
  set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership
  issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.
      Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC
  board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and
  Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other
  directors of violating ""fiduciary duty.""
      De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's
  board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.

  Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> said new
  proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a
  merged telecommunications firm to compete for
  telecommunications contracts did not remove the group's
  objections.
      The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations
  official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals
  made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.
      Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to
  compete against Japan's &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which
  monopolises Japan's overseas telephone business.
      But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of
  the two consortia would be impracticable. ""They are like oil and
  water,"" he said.
      The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have
  proposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has
  been taken up by the British government as a test case on the
  openness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals said
  that the eight core companies of the new group should have
  equal share holdings but added that they could work out the
  precise percentages amongst themselves.
      The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be
  offered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed three
  pct.
      Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, the
  Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially
  the same.
      Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at

  California.
      It said under the agreement, it will pay the state

      WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to

      The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record

  allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of

      Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln

  One of General Electric Co's biggest
  businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing
  profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,
  Wall Street analysts said.
      Previously, it was expected the business would peak and
  decline at some point in the next five years. The improved
  outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new
  planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.
      ""Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,"" said
  Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
      AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
  for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>
  twinjet long distance aircraft.
      But AMR said it was using ""rent-a-plane leases"" that allow
  it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
  structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
  planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
  AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
  downturn in the economy.
      From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
  for several reasons, Heymann said.
      GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
  delivery, Heymann noted.
      And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
  GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
  would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
  wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
  appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
      GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
  midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
  and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company ""no one
  order will have much of an effect on the stock.""
      Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
  order ""will help to maintain a good level of production and
  profitability in the aircraft engine business"" for GE.
      Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
  business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
  by 1991.
      Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
  year, with well over half of the business in the military
  sector, according to analysts' estimates.
      The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
  with an upbeat performance in other segments.
      Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
  quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
  he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
  that it has a ""unique ability"" to buy a major business and
  reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
  elements of its 14 business areas.
      Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current

  Mellon Bank Corp said it expects
  to report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mln
  to 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share.
      The company also said it intends to reduce its second
  quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.
      Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the
  first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in
  charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss
  reserve.
      It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash
  basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.
      In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs
  or 2.13 dlrs a share.
      Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and
  increased provisions address four areas of concern in the
  bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,
  developing countries, some basic industrial companies and
  several commercial real estate businesses.
      Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first
  quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of
  the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of
  total loans at the end of 1986.
      Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the
  first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23
  pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.
      Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45
  billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with
  928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.
      Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in
  energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack
  of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,
  especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to
  increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.
      ""This action relates both to loans to companies directly
  involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,
  home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern
  United States,"" Barnes said.
      As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln
  dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had
  charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt.
      He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit
  Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit
  lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and
  other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts.
      Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to
  the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter
  charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the
  absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries.
      The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued
  management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has
  the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,
  Barnes said.
      ""We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently
  trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them
  aggressively,"" he added.

  The specialty retailing area continues

  dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.
      It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for
  the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years
  ago.
      Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs
  per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs
  per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared
  with the prior year's 5.96 billion.
      For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose
  10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with
  1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.
  Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.
      Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that
  income generated by the company's specialty store operations
  accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.
      He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores
  operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650
  more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it
  operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.
      Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by
  Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman
  apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain
  of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount
  drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,
  which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700
  Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of
  which 1,200 are in the United States.
      Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,
  said in a statement, ""These results are especially gratifying as
  they are an improvement over last year's record earnings.""
      Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in
  each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier
  period.
      Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the
  1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store
  industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth
  opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,
  a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United
  States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.
      In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and
  announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,
  the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.
  Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot
  than general merchandise stores.

  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in
  February had been successful and would be continued.
      Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's
  International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: ""The ...
  Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has
  proven its worth and will also determine future developments.""
      Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he
  would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar
  around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports.
      Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had
  made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major
  efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign
  trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy.
      ""No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the
  U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong
  under-valuation,"" he said.
      Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a
  swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the
  current trade dispute over semi-conductors.
      Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris
  currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but
  noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not
  been published.
      The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which
  central banks of the major industrialised countries would
  intervene.
      Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully
  considered. He said he had nothing further to add.
      Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was
  now no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government to
  stimulate its economy.
      He declined to respond specifically to a question on this
  subject but said, ""You must attach particular importance to the
  consensus which was reached in Paris.""
      The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear
  during his trip to Washington that West Germany's nominal trade
  figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows.
      Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn's exports fell by a
  nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct.
  West Germany's imports dropped largely because of foreign
  currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a
  record trade surplus last year.
      However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany's
  exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports
  had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct.
      In this way West Germany had made its contribution to
  economic stability, Stoltenberg added.
      Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise
  by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating.
      He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for
  West Germany's economic growth this year. The government has
  forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product.
      The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is still
  expecting growth of three pct but some other research
  institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct.
  Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many
  imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic
  changes in official forecasts were needed.

  West Germany's chemical
  industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987
  turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef
  Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.
      Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>,
  told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main
  dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as
  well as crude oil and commodity prices.
      Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming
  earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the
  start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.
      The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was
  badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was
  mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.
      Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and
  competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from
  lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price
  competition and increased costs.
      Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical
  firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved
  financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,
  neutralized the negative impact.
      Strenger said the industry would try to increase production
  in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of
  West Germany.
      The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in
  exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and
  22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.
      Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East
  exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.

  The departure of James Baker's
  closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will
  not change the course of Washington's domestic and
  international economic policies, U.S. officials said.
      Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was
  widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on
  currency management and international economic cooperation.
      U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in
  shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through
  the U.S. Congress.
      But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure,
  to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers,
  signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury
  Secretary himself might leave soon.
      ""It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it
  came up,"" one official said.
      Another commented, ""Baker will miss him, but he's not going
  to stand in his way.""
      There has been widespread speculation since last autumn
  that Darman sought a Wall Street job.
      Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late
  last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.
      Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed.
      ""Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this
  administration over the past six years and his departure
  represents a substantial loss,"" he said.
      U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an
  undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy
  advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term,
  at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as
  ""indispensable"" to Baker.
      Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency
  system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other
  nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring
  target zones to limit currency fluctuations.
      Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury
  unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.
      But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with
  Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives.
      Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council,
  spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with
  the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before.
      Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a
  political strategist ""and that's Baker's strength too,"" the
  official said.
      There were already indications that Baker, who throughout
  his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of
  advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.
      One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould,
  who holds the number three Treasury position of
  Under-Secretary.
      Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years.
      Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a
  partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly
  headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
      The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual
  meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
  where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated.
      He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement,
  when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain
  curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning
  point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic
  cooperation and intervention in currency markets.
      Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like
  the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of
  economic policies among the leading industrial countries and
  the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and
  stimulate global growth.
      These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the
  huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and
  the United State's massive trade deficit.
      That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the
  Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's
  departure.

12815,"EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT
  European Community finance ministers
  and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss
  strengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing
  worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges.
      Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the
  informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank
  chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the
  light of the February agreement among leading industrialised
  countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels.
      In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord
  between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain
  and Canada had proved itself ""more or less workable.""
      But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been
  growing since fears of a trade war between the United States
  and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a
  record low against the surging yen early this week.
      The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held
  to coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third
  World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International
  Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week.
      The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main
  discussions will take place tomorrow.
      Continued international currency turbulence could undermine
  plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint
  float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation
  bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda.
      Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of
  calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable
  dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make
  it more resilient against exchange rate swings.
      The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as
  the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS
  currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake
  two major realignments of parities within nine months.
      In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a
  wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS
  on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the
  EC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank
  Governors.
      The committees were asked to come up with the proposals
  after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January.
      Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the
  fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over
  the mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met
  with a cool response in West Germany.
      He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report
  to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise
  capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such
  as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls.
      Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without
  strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in
  the Community. 
      He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member
  states were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of
  monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included
  management of exchange rates by some kind of common
  institution, instead of by national central banks as at
  present.
      Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by
  the EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the
  reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up
  their sovereignty in the monetary field.
      EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal
  so far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism.

12827,"TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX>
  Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have
  more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a
  possible takeover by Henley Group &lt;HENG>, which has accumulated
  almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad
  conglomerate, analysts said.
      Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley
  disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, but
  analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is
  its intention.
      Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that
  would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems
  combining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatory
  limbo.
      Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa
  Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash
  equivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over
  25 pct. ""This gives them plenty of borrowing power,"" he said,
  which could be used against an unwanted suitor.
      Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants
  to take major positions in undervalued natural resource
  companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking
  an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs.
      Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley might
  launch a takeover. ""I would not characterize the atmosphere
  around here as one of concern,"" one Santa Fe executive said
  about Henley.
      ""I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm
  strategy with Santa Fe,"" said Mark Hassenberg, who covers
  Henley for DLJ Securities.
      Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets are
  likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's efforts
  to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo,
  sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable
  future.
      These realities, they said, support the Henley Group's
  statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment.
      The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming
  difficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topeka
  and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
  The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad.
      Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied
  the merger on anticompetitive grounds.
      The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to
  four western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuade
  it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to
  merge the lines.
      ""My guess is the commission will decide in three to six
  weeks whether to reopen hearings,"" Fischer said.
      ""I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC's
  objections,"" he said. ""But in doing so they haven't pleased
  everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side,
  now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set
  up.""
      If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it will
  take six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and up
  to another year for the ICC to decide.
      Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback
  program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of
  February 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, a
  spokesman said.
      Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by
  Norfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and
  another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said.
      James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight
  off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share
  buybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe's
  options, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake.
      ""It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a
  low-risk, opportunistic investment,"" Voytko said.
      ""People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs
  to 50 dlrs a share,"" said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. ""But I'm
  certain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more than
  that in breakup value.""

12830,"JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS
  Japan should increase foreign access to
  its farm products market, while encouraging further development
  of domestic agriculture, a government report said.
      The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31
  said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at
  the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.
      Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an
  easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which
  stressed the need for strict controls on some products to
  maintain self-sufficiency in food.
      Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,
  down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.
      The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to
  improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.
      The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
  responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
      The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
  has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has
  worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper
  said.
      This could make it difficult to improve the industry's
  structure, the paper said.
      To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices
  to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the
  the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it
  self-supporting, it said.

      Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he

12848,"IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS
  Amid new concerns about inflation,
  interest rate increases and trade confrontations,
  finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss
  a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.
      The meetings, under the auspices of the International
  Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are
  turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,
  upsetting bond and stock markets.
      Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global
  economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue
  to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new
  assistance.
      Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs
  any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary
  James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.
      The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,
  which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of
  commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by
  laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.
      Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a
  visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the
  administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to
  the very poorest states.
      The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers
  in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be
  embraced by the developing countries.
      ""There's interest on the part of some countries for looking
  at the support of the special problems of the very poorest
  countries, because their position is so extreme,"" a Reagan
  administration official said.
      He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.
      The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt
  initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor
  countries grow out of their problems.
      The largest industrial countries have been attempting to
  coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the
  decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other
  problems.
      At the same time, the industrial countries see little
  evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund
  forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.
      The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, 
  continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other
  industrial countries to stimulate their economies.
      These issues directly affect the debt problem and the
  ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their
  difficulties.
      In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of
  developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign
  exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,
  running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others
  to import more from developing countries.
      The discussions, from April six to 10, will be
  wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the
  impact of development loans on the environment, according to
  monetary sources.
      The talks will include an examination of trade
  protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan
  administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on
  microchip products from Japan, the sources said.
      The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial
  markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.
      There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges
  that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair
  market value and has kept its own market closed to imports,
  further undermining the international trading system.
      At the same time, the ministers will discuss the
  fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export
  mainstay of many developing countries.
      The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the
  United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will
  gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,
  where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.
      The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for
  further debate on economic policy coordination.
      As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as
  Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America
  said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.
      Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to
  have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American
  Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and
  economic policy changes in debtor nations.
      Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more
  account of the environment when making loan for dams and other
  projects.
      The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this
  issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization
  plan for the Bank, now being prepared.

  Dutch dairy and general foods
  manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS>, said it is
  planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong
  profit growth over the next 10 years.
       Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the
  presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987
  first quarter profits to show an increase.
      The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986
  net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.
      This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's
  guilder value, van Driel said.
      Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders
  higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985
  level of 3.20 guilders.
      Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln
  guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw
  material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.
      US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,
  compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate
  businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.
      Van Driel said the company would continue an active
  takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more
  than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.
      He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition
  possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.
      He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln
  guilders and would if necessary make new share issues.
      Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln
  dlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy>, taken over
  late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs
  which was not included in the 1986 account.
      All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13
  pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to
  this growth was the successful introduction of new products,
  which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US
  acquisitions, van Driel said.
      Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986
  turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.
      The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,
  Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to
  be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.
      Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be
  accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles
  for the company to raise capital for future expansion.
      He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in
  foreign hands.
      The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a
  listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,
  van Driel said without elaborating.
      Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces
  around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects
  for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said.

  Time Inc's chief financial officer,
  Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is
  ""comfortable"" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings
  will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.
      In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,
  including a number of special items.
      Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special
  items and also removing the earnings of American Television and
  Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in
  1986.
      Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the
  cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly
  in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in
  Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.
      Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a
  Turner Broadcasting spokesman said.
      Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously
  announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back
  4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were
  purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of
  81 dlrs per share.
      Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback
  program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term
  investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not
  give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln
  shares already announced.
     
      On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and
  chief executive said the company is not interested in investing
  in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all
  areas in which it is currently engaged.
      Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.
  In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest
  acquisition ever.
      N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
  the company might be interested in a relatively small book
  business.
      He said following the recent agreement for the sale of
  Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS>, ""there may be pieces
  that Murdoch doesn't want,"" referring to News Corp chairman
  Rupert Murdoch.
      Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munro
  said it is a ""delicate subject"", and ""we're looking at all the
  options."" SAMI is a marketing information service for the food
  industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as
  much as 500 mln dlrs.
     
      Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscribers
  last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of
  1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will be
  down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a
  special gain in the HBO unit.
      Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber
  growth of 800,000 for last year.
      He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under
  50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and
  higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the
  tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points.
      Munro said the company does not plan to increase its
  dividend.
      Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American
  Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at
  getting involved in the home shopping video area. ""It would be
  foolish not to be a player there,"" he said.
      He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network

  In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,

  giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln
  dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over

  Soviet winter grains could be off to

  and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
      Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
  Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
  forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
      But the situation bears careful watching over the next six
  weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and
  future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.
      ""From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
  the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
  lower crop (than last year),"" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist
  for E.F. Hutton said.
      The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will
  be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
  the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.

  us,"" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.
      The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares
  of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
  This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
  and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
  USDA analyst said.
      With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able
  to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
  noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
  -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
      Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
  combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,
  snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
  so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
  due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
      ""Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation
  between mediocre crops and fall dryness,"" Martell said.
      Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
  in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the
  entire winter crop area, she said.
      Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
  snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior
  forecaster for Accu Weather, said.
      Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
  fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,
  the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
  require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
      ""The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
  don't have to buy (grains) now,"" a USDA official said.
      But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and
  if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
  one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet
  buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
      Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
  Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
      ""A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
  a half,"" Martell said.

13046,"CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD
  World Bank President Barber Conable
  expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
  new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
  throughout the industrial world.
      But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
  by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
  goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
  full-scale trade war.
      Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
  countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
  environment increased the possibility of global economic
  growth.
      ""We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
  countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
  opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
  developed world doesn't close at the same time,"" he said.
      He said the U.S. action against Japan was ""a significant
  retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
  trade policy.""
      The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
  meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
      Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
  Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
  and must be closely watched.
      He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
  making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
  developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
  increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
      The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
  debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
  funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
  aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
  and reducing government's role in the economy.
      ""We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
  however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,""
  Conable said.
      He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
  continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
  for some time.
      He noted, ""the problem of debt was a severe one and many
  countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
  problem of debt.""
      Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
  chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
  is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
  the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
  1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
  the World Bank.
      Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
  study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
  several weeks.
      He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
  part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
  poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
  richest countries because of inefficiency.
      the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
  Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
  member-countries as an indication of his management style and
  priorities.
      ""I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
  must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
  permitted to grow,"" Conable said.
      However, he said ""I don't believe there is anything
  basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
  has to have any redefinition of its purpose.""
      He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
  initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
  in dealing with the debt crisis.
      Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
  sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
  that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
  Camdessus on a variety of issues.
      On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
  to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that ""I don't have
  a particular mission here except to be useful to the
  institution and to the process of development.""
      He added, ""so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
  the institution.""
      On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
  that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
  the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
  of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
  Association was earmarked for Africa.
      Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
  forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those
  in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.

13053,"U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING
  A steep drop in goods-producing jobs
  detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes
  it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary
  policy to defend the dollar, economists said.
      U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less
  than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets
  expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with
  February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment
  dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.
      ""The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we
  end the first quarter,"" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley
  and Co Inc. ""This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in
  the second and third quarters.""
      ""The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,""
  he said. ""They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but
  clearly they can't tighten.""
      David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward
  revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000
  from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter
  were weaker than expected.
      While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.
  gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March
  jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter
  growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.
      Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average
  monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only
  237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.
      ""There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, 
  but less than assumed,"" he said. ""Gains in goods-producing jobs
  were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed
  tightening for exchange-related purposes.""
      In March, the average workweek fell back to its January
  level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing
  hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9
  hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.
      The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing
  jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and 
  electronic manufacturing.
      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a
  13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for
  nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.
      Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories
  resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with
  the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.
      Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five
  pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in
  the first-quarter GNP accounts.
      Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two
  pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the
  second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial
  activity ""is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate
  contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.""
      Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains
  in industrial production and personal income for March.
  They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for
  these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct
  in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.
      Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop
  in March construction employment may also signal a drop in
  March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851
  million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in
  January.
      The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level
  since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed
  out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which 
  fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.
      ""This just means that there were fewer people looking for
  work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,"" he said.
      He said the latest employment report will not concern the
  Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of
  2.5-3.0 pct, but ""it does suggest they can't afford to tighten
  to quickly either.""
      The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal
  fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor
  force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them
  in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with
  his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.
      Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think
  that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their
  meeting this week. ""At some point they will be more inclined to
  ease,"" he said. For the time being, however, the March
  employment report ""increases the likelihood they won't tighten,
  regardless of the dollar.""

1306,"OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT
  Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
  over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
  effort to support prices, analysts said.
      ""The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
  hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
  another meeting,"" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      ""But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
  seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,"" he added.
      Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
  to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
  the official prices agreed to last december.
      The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
  Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
  of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
  Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
      The Saudis have also offered to support members having
  difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
      ""They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
  prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
  member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
  that lose sales,"" Margoshes said.
      He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
  of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
      Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
  nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
  is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
  Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
      Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
  president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
  meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
  December pact is falling apart.
      Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
  Harris and Co said, ""both physical and futures markets have been
  oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
  covering rally.""
      He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
  refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
  into the market to cover their short positions.
      Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
  to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
  sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
  yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
  North sea crude oil market.
      Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
  that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
  for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
  being fixed to make such shipments.
      North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
  reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
      OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
  quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
      Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
  production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
  december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
  claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
      ""The production probably is about their quota level and
  largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
  its oil as a result,"" Margoshes said.
      Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
  current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
  Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
      But others said that despite the rally today there were
  still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
  could cut the rally short.
      Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
  slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
  demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
  about 1.4 pct over 1986.

13072,"SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES
  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for
  the shares of companies that they must extend the period their
  offers are open if key conditions are changed.
      Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers
  for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to
  eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be
  tendered in order for the offers to be valid.
      Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.
  As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares
  that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.
      In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said
  clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender
  offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,
  even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.
      The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share
  condition is a ""material change"" of the tender offer under U.S.
  securities law, SEC officials said.
      The SEC has already said that other specific material
  changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being
  sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a
  tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.
      The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving
  shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender
  offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share
  conditions were waived.
      SEC officials said the length of the extension in such
  cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding
  each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.
      The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers
  of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each
  offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new
  information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.
      ""If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of
  its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate
  dissemination,"" the SEC said.
      Federal securities law requires that all tender offers
  remain open for at least 20 business days.

13115,"CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS
  Firmer crude oil prices, government aid
  packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil
  industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry
  analysts said.
      They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987
  compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped
  about 50 pct.
      On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to
  their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at
  record highs.
      ""This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the
  part of the investment community that the outlook for the
  industry for the future is extremely attractive,"" Peters and Co
  Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.
      Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,
  culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr
  1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last
  year's results, analysts said.
      ""But the financial statements are a snap shot and a
  recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the
  future,"" Gobert commented.
      The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41
  companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15
  at the end of 1986.
      Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of
  Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is
  trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.
      Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
  is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.
  Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is
  at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.
      Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts
  operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas
  companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs
  and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion
  dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.
  dlrs a barrel. ""However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a
  barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase
  with cash flow 27 pct higher,"" analyst Plexman said.
      ""Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the
  profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,""
  he added.
      Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when
  operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05
  billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90
  billion dlrs.
      But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold
  recent gains and more government assistance is needed.
      Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans
  Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,
  after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude
  oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC
  production accord will continue to support prices.
      However, several companies share the optimistic industry
  outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.
      Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast
  improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this
  week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.
      ""The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not
  robust,"" Texaco Canada said in its annual report.
      ""While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is
  good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,
  continued volatility is likely,"" Texaco Canada added.
      In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have
  pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,
  deferring most frontier exploration work.
      ""The industry is becoming very selective in investments,
  very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,""
  Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.
      Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion
  the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.
      The most significant help came last September when the
  federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax
  (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.
      Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil
  companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
      The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow
  decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further
  exploration spending cuts, analysts said.
      ""For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely
  necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that
  were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably
  more,"" Maciej said.

      The utility had previously said it might be forced to
  consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate
  increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf
  States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.
      ""If the regulatory commissions approve the company's
  proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided
  for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,
  the company believes it could achieve financial stability,""
  Gulf States said.
      In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted
  Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs
  contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of
  credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1
  mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.
      Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state
  regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in
  emergency rate relief.
      In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of
  1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on
  sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.

  British Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the
  only element standing in the way of full British membership of
  the European Monetary System (EMS).
      But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.
      Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the
  strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made
  clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the
  next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.
      But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after
  an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here
  that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in
  the way of full membership.
      In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which
  Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism,
  there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system
  to be considered, he said.
      British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system
  based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling
  system, he noted. ""We have to make sure it would work.""
      But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had
  made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed
  less of a problem.
      As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency,
  which he said was diminishing. ""That argument has clearly
  weakened,"" he said.
      Lawson restated that the government was keeping the
  question of membership under review.

13244,"EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS
  European Community (EC)
  finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for
  greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System
  (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.
      ""There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary
  System, with all that implies,"" Belgian Finance Minister Mark
  Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of
  informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.
      The gathering was the first such discussion since the
  second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in
  January.
      The system has come under severe strain as funds have
  flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS
  currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against
  weaker currencies in the system.
      But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading
  western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at
  around current levels was working and this would allow the EC
  to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the
  EMS.
      He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the
  need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of
  interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials
  between different countries.
      They also agreed they needed better coordination of
  exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both
  when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their
  agreed margins.
      But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of
  technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in
  Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's
  Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.
      He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic
  convergence betwen Community countries and it was important
  that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange
  rates and inflation rates.
      The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the
  presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not
  produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing
  the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and
  monetary integration.
      ""We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal
  functioning of the system,"" Eyskens said.
      Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS
  has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all
  movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go
  ahead.
      EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the
  meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final
  phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would
  include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the
  move would create difficulties.
      Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also
  discussed the need to ""dedramatise"" realignments of EMS parities
  by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by
  telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.
      However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister
  Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.
      British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told
  journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater
  coordination of exchange market intervention was the question
  of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in
  central bank reserves.
      He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would
  work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an
  issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the
  Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.
      He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments
  reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the
  January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.
     The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and
  West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in
  the system that forced the parity overhaul.

      The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction,

      Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine

      The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy

  months longer than planned.
      The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to

13256,"IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND
  Growth in oil consumption in the Western
  industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
  this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
  Energy Agency (IEA) said.
      Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
  one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
  its Monthly Oil Market Report.
      Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
  transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
  higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
  below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
      The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
  stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
  be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
  of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
  may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
      IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
  428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
  This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
      The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
  projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
  the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
      It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
  by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
  year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
  a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
      It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
  particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
  there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
  stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
  up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
  period.
      The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
  continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
  or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
  years, the IEA noted.
      Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
  mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
  1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
  respectively.
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
  1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption.
      World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
  bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
  mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
  centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
      Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
  quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
  of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
  for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
  28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
      A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
  3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
  largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
  said.
      Saudi Arabia""s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

13261,"U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING
  U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain
  cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias
  as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the
  economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.
      Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,
  that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will
  keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.
      Until trends are clearer, ""the market can only attempt to to
  establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest
  rates,"" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
      Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy
  said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy
  investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this
  environment until there is illumination of and confidence in
  U.S. Dollar/trade policy.
      Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,
  highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if
  currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas
  economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.
      ""The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these
  developments is likely to occur,"" Kaufman said.
      ""Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager
  confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while
  longer,"" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving
  Securities Corp.
      However, Braverman said that, ""from a longer term
  perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying
  opportunity.""
      Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on
  unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury
  bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and
  Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.
      Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long
  bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.
  Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.
      The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a
  similar ""paroxysm of pessimism,"" the key bonds reached a similar
  closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,
  however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the
  yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.
      Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said
  that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach
  nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.
      Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have
  spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and
  they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to
  persist over the next few months.
      Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers
  last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate
  rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by
  midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.
      ""Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the
  rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen
  since the start of the year,"" Held said.
      Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.
      ""The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,"" said
  economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
      They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up
  interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar
  and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm
  the fragile U.S. Economic expansion.
      The Lanston economists said, ""The Fed cannot ease its policy
  stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm
  domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of
  causing a further decline in the dollar.""
      Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
  meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy
  unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy
  later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit
  markets warranted a policy shift.
      However, economists generally believe that continued fairly
  sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.
  Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing
  countries rule out any Fed policy firming.
      There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at
  last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.
      This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little
  impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on
  Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.
      There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.
  Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic
  indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A
  Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first
  quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP
  growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.
      Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are
  expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen.

  Caesars World Inc &lt;CAW> said its
  directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under
  which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per
  share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain
  their common stock ownership in Caesars World.
      Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately
  one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend
  and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln
  dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800
  mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.
      Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has
  told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire
  financing needed for the recapitalization.
      Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the
  hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the
  board believes the recapitalization plan is financially
  superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.
      Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends
  that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.
      The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.
      ""Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible
  primarily because of the financial stability and the strong
  operating results achieved by management in recent years,"" Gluck
  said.
      He said that after the recapitalization takes effect,
  proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is
  expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.
      Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be
  76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization
  common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.
      Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,
  Gluck said ""we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs
  in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower
  interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt
  incurred in connection with the recapitalization.""
      He said the company does not usually release projections,
  but has done so now beause of the significance of the
  recapitalization.
      Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for
  stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.
      The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that
  of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.
      As part of the plan, the company will change its state of
  incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of
  Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.
      The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide
  for, among other things, a ""fair price"" provision requiring that
  certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be
  approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares
  held by such interested stockholders.
      Caesars World said in a statement that ""the cash
  distribution will result in a substantial deficit in
  stockholders' equity."" It did not give an estimate of the size
  of this deficit.
      But the company said its financial advisors have said they
  believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should
  have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to
  finance its current and projected operating and capital
  requirements.

  A study on grain certificates due out
  shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show
  that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
  cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
      Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture
  Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests
  that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official
  told Reuters.
      GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific
  request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the
  senate agriculture committee.
      The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
  compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.
      The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on
  the program's impact on the USDA loan program.
      If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan
  entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
  the program would go up. However, if it is determined that
  certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
  decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
      GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates
  program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
      But a negative report on certificates ""will fuel the fire
  against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase
  in the certificate program,"" an agricultural consultant said.

13649,"BRITAIN WARNS JAPAN OVER TRADE ROW
  British corporate affairs minister Michael
  Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable
  and Wireless Plc's &lt;CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanese
  telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in
  trade relations.
      In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications
  ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way
  Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade
  imbalance between the two countries.
      ""I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that
  I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt
  deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which
  would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,""
  Howard told reporters.
      ""He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the
  message got home,"" he added.
      British frustration over the lopsided trade balance -
  nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has
  reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard
  said.
      Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and
  Wireless from having a major role in the international
  telephone market in Japan.
      ""I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I
  want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading
  relations,"" Howard said. ""We simply aren't prepared to continue
  to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a
  long time.""
      Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable
  to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister.
      But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister
  Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are
  increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.
      Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications
  dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.
      Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering
  possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the
  telecommunications issue.
      ""There are measures which are under consideration if we
  continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,""
  he added, but gave no details.
      He said he had received a reassuring response from the
  Japanese he has spoken with.
      ""But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese
  for quite some time,"" he added. ""What I've made plain is we
  expect to see action.""
      Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial
  Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.
  Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms
  like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms
  equal access to overseas financial markets.

1387,"SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION
  Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring
  other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
  Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan
  Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.
      Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil
  engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to
  attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years
  to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
      ""Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted
  effort by the Saudis to get production down,"" Wellemeyer said.
      ""The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
  barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,"" he said.
      In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
  barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing
  above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln
  barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.
  crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
  belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.
      Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production
  could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
  early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
      Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil
  should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the
  organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
  barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
  switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market
  accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the
  world demand for oil.

  Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rose
  sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings
  scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday,
  traders and analysts said.
      The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987,
  ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago.
      That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of
  Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for
  the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his
  previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company
  earned 70 cts a share.
      Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.
      At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's
  president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of
  1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 ""are expected to cause
  even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low.""
      Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of
  this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of
  90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that
  Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved
  for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.
      Crossen said ""because Marion is still just a small company,
  the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom
  line."" He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a
  share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.
      ""The company has a broad new product pipeline in the
  industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most
  innovative company in the business,"" he said.
      For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to
  have a growth rate of 55 pct.

13908,"U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE
  The United States has appealed for
  stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) to enforce world trade rules.
      The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
  at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
  a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
  the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.
      Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
  launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers
  13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and
  services will take four years to negotiate.
      Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial
  institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
  Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
  ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.
      ""The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
  assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
  world trading system and the global economy,"" Smith said.
      ""Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,
  or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.""
      He also also urged that member states be accountable to
  each other for their trade policies.
      Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
  Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to
  stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.
      ""We are interested in more periodic ministerial
  involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,"" he said.
      GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
  12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on
  semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
  rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
  chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
  panel be set up to review the agreement.
      President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
  round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose
  tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.
      He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets
  to U.S. Exports.

  This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in
  Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached
  at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in
  Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international
  monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.
      It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans
  to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo
  accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.
      On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its

  Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier
  session of talks involving G-5 members.

      Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the
  grounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, West

  State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce
  Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with
  many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is
  likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus
  Industrie> A340 aircraft.
      The company's so-called ""pathfinder prospectus"" gives all the
  details of its stock market flotation except for the price at
  which shares will be offered.
      Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose
  in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.
      Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit
  for 1987.
      Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits
  and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls
  operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.
      Assuming the company was valued at around eight times
  earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about
  1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the
  aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.
      BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between
  1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.
      The price will be increased by it being likely to have much
  of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the
  company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was
  rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.
      When the government announced the sale, it said it would
  inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250
  mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.
      Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit
  rating to match those of its main competitors such as General
  Electric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt
  and Whitney unit.

  Japan is attempting to cut back
  semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.
  tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April
  17, industry analysts said.
      The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a
  possible shortage of the key computer components in the next
  few weeks, the analysts said.
      ""Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of
  the Japanese semiconductor industry,"" analyst Drew Peck of
  Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.
      But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,
  and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in
  forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.
      Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was
  already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted
  sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell
  chips at below production costs.
      ""We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and
  it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,"" said Merrill Lynch
  analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in
  computers.
      ""Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are
  stretching,"" Kurlack added.
      Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International
  Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in
  production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor
  accord with the U.S.
      The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on
  Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to
  live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer
  components in the U.S. market.
      But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.
  was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of
  trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.
      As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices
  will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor
  manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long
  ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers
  that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.
      ""The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade
  pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're
  demonstating their muscle,"" analyst Peck said.
      The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to
  benefit U.S. chip makers.
      ""I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.
  semiconductor manufacturers,"" industry analyst Elliot Levine of
  Ladenburg Thalmann Co said.
      But analyst Peck said, ""it will take a few weeks to see
  whether Japan has genuinely cut production.""
      He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's
  request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and
  production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in
  plant and equipment.

14212,"U.S. GRAIN CERTS SAVE 50-100 MLN DLRS - AMSTUTZ
  The use of generic commodity
  certificates, or ""certs,"" for fiscal years 1986-88 will save
  the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture
  Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.
      Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the
  use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5
  billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could
  result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.
      However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450
  to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net
  savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.
      Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly the
  entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been
  forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.
      In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been
  redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would
  have remained in the goverment inventory, he said.
      When asked to comment on a recent study by the General
  Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net
  cost to the government, Amstutz said, ""GAO underestimated the
  benefits and overstated the costs"" of the certificate program.
      Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan
  entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather
  than forfeitures.
      GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.
      ""There is no question in the mind of the Department of
  Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful,""
  Amstutz said.
      Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market
  liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm
  income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying
  costs, he said.
      Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-range
  market-oriented farm policy, he said.
      Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman,
  D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official
  response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to
  the subcommittee when completed.

14313,"MORE U.S. GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED, STUDY SAYS
  More generic grain certificates
  should be released onto the market in order for the U.S.
  certificate program to have its full effect on commodities,
  according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.
      The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency
  payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third
  certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, 
  Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a
  House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.
      Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly
  a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.
      The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible
  scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a ""zero
  certificate case,"" where no certificate program was assumed,
  and an alternative case labeled ""adequate certificate case"" in
  which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain
  prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages
  due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.
      The study showed that total grain use under the adequate
  certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario
  by 11.2 pct.
      Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain
  usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the
  zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.
      For the five-year period examined, government expenditures
  under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or
  7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.
      The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of
  those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.
      The study also estimated that government grain stocks under
  the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels
  below the zero certificate case at the end of the period
  examined.
      The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market
  prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase
  commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus
  cash.

  OPEC may be forced to meet before a
  scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
  agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
  in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
      ""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
  as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
  the problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
  Research Associates, CERA.
      Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
  faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
      ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
  issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oil
  analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
      He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
  ability to keep production under control have given way to a
  pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
  it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
      But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
  emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
  above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
      ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
  deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the
  regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
  on condition that he not be named. ""The market is now trying to
  teach them that lesson again,"" he added.
      David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
  to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
  not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
      ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
  winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
  when demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said.
      But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
  than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.""
      Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
  OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
      ""OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
  since buyers will come back into the market then,"" said Dillard
  Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
      But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
  and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
  has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
  prompted excesses in its production.
      ""Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
  and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
  are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
  demand through current production,"" he told Reuters in a

  &lt;British Columbia
  Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year
  operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with
  five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a
  four year term.
      The company said the credit facility is extendable under
  certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five
  mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals
  and completion of formal documentation.
      It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items
  rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.
      B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2
  preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain
  suspended.
      However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly
  dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's
  trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.
      Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of
  the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred
  shareholders, with payment expected in early April to
  shareholders of record March 31, the company said.
      If future dividends are not declared after the April
  exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
  depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast
  Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said.
      The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
  operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
  four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
  Columbia.
      B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary
  loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
  gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>.
      B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
  writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the
  sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
  Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the
  company said.
      The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.
  Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
  exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.
      It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs
  from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes
  and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.

  of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns
  contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a
  share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985.
      The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs
  against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues
  in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the
  year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.
      Williams also said the previously announced sale of its
  Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners
  Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.
      The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the
  Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred
  payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake
  in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.
      In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2
  mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.
      Williams said the charges in the current year were related
  to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring
  moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook
  for future stability and growth in earnings.
      Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp
  unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The
  Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs
  compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.
      Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from
  about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit
  of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

  A group of Canadian lawmakers from
  Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada
  from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major
  trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.
      At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an
  organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the
  Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said
  the exemption would help trade relations.
      The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in

  foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would
  harm the U.S. economy.
      Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any

      Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.
  congressmen, ""I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has
  to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world.""
      ""I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You
  do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely
  consider exempting our country from that bill,"" he added.
      Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with

  Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan
  this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European
  Community levels, director-general of the INFE export
  institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.
      ""The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic
  Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,"" he
  said.
       ""This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there
  is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,
  which have a similar productive structure,"" he said.
      The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other
  fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in
  international trade fairs.
      Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as
  traditional industrial exports will be promoted.
      Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20
  billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the
  government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special
  25 billion peseta grant.
      The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in
  real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.
      Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in
  developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,
  which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.
      He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  countries.
      The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the
  Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to
  concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.
      ""The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are
  vital to survival in the context of EC competition,"" he said.
      He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the
  domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while
  turning their backs on foreign markets.
      ""They have to realise their share of the home market is

  with a loss of 3.3 mln dlrs, or 21 cts per share, in 1985's
  fourth quarter.
      For the year, however, the diversified holding company
  reported a net profit of 43.9 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share,
  versus 46.4 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, in 1985.
      David Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
  ""Both our food business and our real estate operations
  increased their earnings during the year (1986).""
      But, he added that Flexi-Van's 1986 results were hit by
  depressed daily rental rates for leased equipment caused by
  oversupplies.
      The company also reported that George Elkas, formerly
  executive vice president,  has been named president and chief
  operating officer of Flexi-Van Corp, while William Burns has
  been named executive vice president of Flexi-Van.

1616,"ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION
  Drilling for oil in California is
  likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
  despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
  said.
      Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
  thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
  increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
  is seen in drilling, they said.
      ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,""
  said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
      Few new wells now are being drilled.
      Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
  were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
  to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
  Information Services, which tracks California drilling
  activity.
      ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state's
  drilling activity.
      Current prices are not enough to justify increased
  drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
  Producers Association.
      While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
  to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
  eventually fell.
      Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
  slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
  of about 17 dlrs.
      More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
  wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
  much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
  extract, Malmgreen said.
      ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,""
  Malmgreen said.
      Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
  produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
  wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
  extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
      The outlook for future production in California is clouded
  by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
      In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
  produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
  drilling has slowed to a crawl.
      Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
  1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
  the state energy commission. So far this year only five
  exploratory wells have been drilled.
      ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
  year,"" Mitchell said.
      No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
  the decade, Mitchell said.
      Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
  number of producing wells and overall production.
      Between February and October of 1986, the number of
  producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
  more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
  Commission.
      In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
  fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
  expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
      Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
  production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
  per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
      Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
  was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
  mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
  Conservation.
      ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,""
  Guerard said.

  not be easy to fulfil.
      Without giving figures, the newspaper said: ""A considerable

      The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of
  winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.
      A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has

      ""The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes

  The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
  approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted

      Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore

  Wall Street traders said the stock of
  Outboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable
  television program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of
  Sun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL>.
      Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8
  to 31-1/2 Tuesday.
      A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has
  4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go
  for control of the whole company.
      An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the
  rumor.
      The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up
  to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.
      A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.
      Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan
  that will be triggered when a person or group acquires
  beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins
  a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.
      Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic
  planning, said management wants to stay independent. ""We are
  not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our
  strategic plans,"" he said.
      That plan includes integrating five boat companies that
  Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones
  said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.
      An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a
  ""decent"" price for outboard. ""A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
  share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops,"" he said.
      Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
  registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan
  Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical
  to strike before the offering is underway.

1682,"TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>
  General Motors Corp staged an explosive
  rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced
  yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by
  stiff competition and erosion of market share.
      GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts
  agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
  differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
      ""I'm very positive on GM,"" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder
  Peabody and Co. ""They're clearly committed to enhancing
  shareholder value.""
      However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the
  buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
  recapture lost market share.
      After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy
  back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The
  announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,
  with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
      The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
  stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
  least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a
  good performance expected from new car models.
      But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the
  repurchase program is not a positive.
      ""The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
  puts more stress on the balance sheet,"" he said, since GM will
  have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock
  should settle back down to around 76, he added.
      Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
  5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
  Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,
  which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
  dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
      Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic
  car and truck market falling in 1987. ""On balance, GM cars are
  not selling as well as their competitors,"" he said.
      In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
  year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
  Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February
  sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects
  improvement in coming months.
      Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall
  to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
  analysts said. The numbers include imports.
      Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product
  improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
  fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.
      ""GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
  its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major
  earnings surprise in the winds,"" he said.
      Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
  part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning
  5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. ""The company is more
  concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
  with respect to Ford and Chrysler,"" he said.
      Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently
  five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
  its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash
  dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
      But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
  said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if
  successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
  market share.
      ""I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
  only curtail losses in market share,"" which will fall to around
  35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.
      Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle
  of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he
  said results will not improve until 1988.
      ""I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a
  transition year for GM,"" he said.
      Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
  at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
  affect 1987 results. ""But the key thing isn't so much what they
  earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's
  important.""

1696,"TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS
  French oil group Total Cie Francaise des
  Petroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc
  consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,
  after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the
  company said in a communique after a board meeting here.
      In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told
  journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar
  had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net
  profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a
  consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.
      Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's
  refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de
  Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told
  journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the
  subsidiary before stock depreciation.
      CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and
  currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16
  billion loss in 1985.
      But its net loss last year, taking account of that
  depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion
  francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.
      In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from
  20.9 mln ""due to the growth in imports by independent
  distributors following a relaxation of regulations,"" Guilbaud
  said.
      The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000
  this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job
  reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln
  francs, he said.

  Texas Railroad Commissioner James
  Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
  Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt
  incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
  taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
      Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of
  representatives that the state must take the initiative in
  molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
  troubled oil producers.
      His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt
  stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
  from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the
  majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
  category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
  crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
      Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
  wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
  as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
      Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
  production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
  oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent
  said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
  wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
  for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
  barrel.
      ""We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
  administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
  nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,"" Nugent
  said. ""In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,
  follow, or get out of the way.""
      Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury
  by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes
  would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the
  oil supply and service industry.

  Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
  continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
  or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
      Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
  billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
  remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial
  spending will be internally financed.
      Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
  regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific
  Bell operating company.
      In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility
  Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
  revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
  commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
      The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
  rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found
  180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
  and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
  modernization costs.
      Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
  to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
  transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.
      ""We have not agreed to anything,"" Guinn said, but added he
  would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
  company would make a decision soon on participating.
      Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
  U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating
  companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said
  the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
      ""(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.
  It's a commodity business and becoming more so,"" he said. ""I'm
  not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
  business.""
      However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.
  recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
  Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
  businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
  alliances with other companies.
      He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
  new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
  talks. ""We do not have anything actively under consideration,""

  its proposed move.

  wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International
  Inc in 60 to 90 days.
      Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of
  entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and
  their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.
      ""We've had counsel working for some time in every region
  where Viacom has cable televison systems"" Redstone told Reuters
  in a telephone interview.
      Redstone also said ""Viacom is committed to working very
  closely with us to obtain approvals."" Viacom has been seeking
  approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable
  systems since September when its management group first
  advanced a buyout plan.
      But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding
  contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that
  Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into
  a defintive merger agreement with National.
      National is a family business which operates a chain of
  movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.
      Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through
  the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading
  electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion
  picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.
      Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,
  four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said
  exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the
  emerging trend. ""Up until recently you could see any motion
  picture on any pay channel,"" Redstone said.
      He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios
  and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.
      Redstone said the management group's investment bankers
  will be paid what is due for termination of its merger
  agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. ""That will
  be a company expense,"" Redstone said.
      He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries
  from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr

1809,"BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM
  A senior British official said that
  protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
  retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
  global trading system.
      Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
  Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
  would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
  textile producers, ""the community would have to retaliate.""
      His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
  Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
  community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
      Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
  days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
  of Congress.
      De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
      Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
  Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
  Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
  deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
      Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
  force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
      Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
  problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
  51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
      ""The more united pressure there could be, the better,"" he
  said.
      Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
  avoid trade disputes.
      He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
  earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
  Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
  regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
      ""But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,"" he
  said, """"it does not mean that they would do so on another
  occasion.""
      Channon added that ""There is increasing reesentment in
  Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
  of unilaterally imposed deadlines.""
      He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
  alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
  taxes on fats and oils - and ""the commuity and the United States
  must therefore learn to manage their relations better.""
      He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
  against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
  goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
  Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
      He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not
  by the United States, adding ""if the (trade) law is to be
  interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is
  to happen to the rest of us?""

  Trans World Airlines Inc complicated
  the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy
  Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with
  Piedmont and USAir.
      Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street
  speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk
  Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly
  after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
      TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It
  also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and
  threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer
  for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
      TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
  USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said
  it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
  airlines.
      Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman
  Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
  the takeover arena.
      ""We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA
  into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to
  move onto somthing else,"" said one arbitrager. ""We think TWA
  might just be putting up a trial balloon.""
      Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,
  but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
  is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
      They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by
  revealing financing arrangements. ""They need to show their
  commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a
  credible offer,"" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.
      ""I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
  of airline deals,"" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
  be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
      USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A
  spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not
  changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of
  that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
  for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.
      USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
  shares.
      Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
  remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding
  65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
      Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
  its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont
  and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
  of Piedmont.
      Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to
  make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
      ""Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there
  were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for
  making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish
  that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
  airlines,"" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.
      ""I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
  way it becomes a much more viable package,"" said Kim.
      But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
  remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.
      Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do
  the offer.
      The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial
  advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
     Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>
  and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
      Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was
  impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham
  Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
      Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA
  offer on price and financing concerns. ""It's littered with
  contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
  arrangement,"" said one executive at another major airline.
      But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a
  strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and
  planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the
  intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in
  its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
  to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
      The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation
  system.
      Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
  result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

  Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding
  Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with
  Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim
  its debts, chairman Louis Lo said.
      He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint
  production venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi Dockyard
  Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been
  held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy
  Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
  Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>, he said.
      Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty
  foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,
  which would complete production.
      ""We expect the successful cooperation between us and
  Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other
  Japanese shipbuilders in the future,"" Lo said.
      He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of
  shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese
  technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to
  competitors in Europe and South Korea.
      Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs
  since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands
  at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly
  three mln dlrs.
      But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest
  shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun
  diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and
  other machinery.
      ""We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,""
  he said.
      Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln
  U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the
  previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more
  than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.

  OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to

  The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp
  &lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
  13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
  share analysts polled by Reuters said.
      Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
  ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be
  announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
      They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
  42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
  one-for-five bonus issue.
      Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
  issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
      The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>
  is to report its 1986 results on Friday.
      Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more
  than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
  12 pct.
      They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
  for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
      Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
  reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
  Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
  Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
  nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
      ""They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
  as their loan portfolio is well balanced,"" an analyst at Mansion
  House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.
      Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
  by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
      Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
  the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
  pct in 1985.
      Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received
  on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
  but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and
  Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
  system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
      The strength of the real-estate market was another major
  income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property
  development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
      ""The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
  business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
  and other foreign banks,"" one analyst said.
      The high level of activity on the capital and equities
  markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong
  Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and
  Co>, analysts said. ""Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
  financial adviser and underwriter,"" an analyst said.
      Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
  flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong
  Bank owned 30 pct at the time.
      The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
  for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
  in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two
  English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
      The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
  not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
      Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
  need to write off bad debts. ""The need for provisions was much
  lower than the year before,"" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
  Securities Co Ltd. ""Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
  2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.""
      Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
  bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
  shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
  Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She
  forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
      The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its
  51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have
  improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986
  fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs
  from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145
  mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.

  The Papua New Guinea Government
  will establish a public corporation to invest in resources
  projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.
      ""We intend to provide a means through which less privileged
  individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the
  development of mining and petroleum projects,"" he told
  Parliament.
      Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in
  major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects
  would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take
  over the state's equity in current developments.
      Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with
  exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on
  about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.
      ""The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New
  Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases
  in an orderly way,"" he said.

  U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic

      ""Our central message to Japan this week was that while we

1963,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS
  Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its
  economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
  to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
  restrictions two weeks ago.
      Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
  of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
  hypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated to
  convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said.
      But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
  impossible to calculate.
      They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
  economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
      ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
  achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
  contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said.
      The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
  Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
  for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
  martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
  originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
  National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
  commission.
      According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
  economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
  trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
  credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
      But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
  booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
  the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point,
  which has no real scientific evaluation.""
      A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
  the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
  annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
  imposed.
      Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
  200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
  surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
  against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
      Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
  U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
  chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
  dried up for economic not political reasons.  ""Poland is
  accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
  political reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on a
  misunderstanding of Western economy.""
      ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
  who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that
  Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
  in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
      Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one
  diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
  and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
  scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
  lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
  on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
  and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
      ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
  be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
  regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
  in play now,"" said one Western envoy.
      He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
  quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
  measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
  Poland's efforts to regain entry.
      Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
  this fact recently.
      Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Making
  up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
  difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
  two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
  exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.""
      While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
  has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
  imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
  ""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
  of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
  just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
  Solidarity.""
      Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
  talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
  Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
  looking for a lead from the United States.
      He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
  financial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a short
  time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
  foreign economic partners.""
      He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity to
  play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
  interested in the settlement of Polish debt.""
      Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
  Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
  Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
  said it should now play a more positive role.
      ""As a major superpower the United States can influence
  international organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetings
  aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
  which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

1990,"EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING
  OPEC crude oil output in the first few
  days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
  mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
  ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
      The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
  traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
  East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
      They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
  group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
  a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
      OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
  above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
  United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
      The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
  was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
  survey reveals.
      But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
  in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran""s inability to
  export as much as its quota allows.
      Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
  1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
      Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
  3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
  against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
  200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
      Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
  estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
  early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
  of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
      Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
  OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
  both substantially under quota in February and early March.
      Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
  180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
      Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar""s
  prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
  shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
      Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
  from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
      Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
  grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
  from the U.K. North Sea.

  Baker International corp said it has
  filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co

      Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger
  agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative
  divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had
  previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
  decree that would have required broader divestitures.
      Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation

  Department consent decree.

  shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the

  was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
      Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
  merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were ""more
  burdensome"" than those of the consent decree themselves.
      Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
  reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
  or three pct.
      Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
  the units named in the consent decree.
      It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
  its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
  live up to the merger agreement or ""substantial"" monetary

  Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its
  new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a
  strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir
  John Egan told a news conference.
      Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to
  830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly
  below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average
  profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of
  the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.
      Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to
  sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.
      U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,
  finance director John Edwards said.
      A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards
  said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German
  competitors offered an ""umbrella"" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6
  had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would
  restrict the car's price.
      Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
  12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
  its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.
      In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10
  pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct
  of net sales and training two pct.
      Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
  other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the
  building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,
  but Egan said this would take at least another three years
      On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last

2025,"YEUTTER PUTS CURRENCY BURDEN ON TAIWAN, KOREA
  Responsibility for the appreciation of
  the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with
  those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter
      Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in
  those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of
  their currencies against the dollar.
      Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.
  could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against
  the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits
  with Taiwain and Korea.
      ""An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports
  in the short term, but in the long run they have to be
  concerned about how they are perceived in the international
  business community,"" Yeutter said.
      For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade
  surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and
  with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend
  the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that
  country.
      He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move
  to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, ""otherwise in two
  or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that
  prevails in Taiwan.""
      Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50
  billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not
  sustainable.
      ""Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat
  of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend,"" Yeutter
  said.

2064,"BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE
  Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's
  decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings
  banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's
  determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation
  despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.
      The central bank last night raised the requirement by one
  percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess
  liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.
      Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the
  Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to
  choke off money supply growth.
      ""I think it's a good measure,"" a senior foreign banker said.
  ""It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates
  and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.""
      ""It shows that the political will is very strong. They know
  that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive
  and bring down unemployment in the long run,"" he added.
      The head of another foreign bank said that only a month
  ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise
  in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of
  raising interest rates.
      But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now
  -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money
  from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish
  exports less competitive.
      The government says industry's competitiveness is also
  being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was
  way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the
  European Community, which it joined a year ago.
      To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is
  insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for
  clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough
  sacrifices.
      Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose
  demands essentially involve more government spending, have
  become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe
  Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.
      Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have
  some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the
  money market too hard.
      The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key
  overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at
  today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since
  the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.
      Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in
  any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate
  banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.
      The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the
  publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers
  say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,
  inevitably, push lending rates higher.
      A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which
  banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect
  tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month
  that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher
  interest rates.

  Securities and Exchange Commission
  chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping
  insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with
  jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about
  conditions on Wall Street.
      ""Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in
  the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations
  have become easy prey,"" Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the
  chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the
  start of a hearing on SEC activities.
      ""Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the
  current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,""
  Markey said. ""The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania
  is particularly distressing.""
      Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis
  Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in
  insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high
  fines and disbarment from the securities industry.
      ""Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been
  inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky
  and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing
  through to legitimate investors and traders,"" Shad said in his
  statement.
      Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or
  less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have
  increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past
  five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.
      Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought
  the tender offer process needed reform including earlier
  disclosure of takeover attempts.
      N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee
  Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a
  five member commission to study the securities industry for a
  year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress.
  Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.
      ""Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of
  illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy
  of existing surveillance systems and government oversight
  operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what
  additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed
  to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws,""

  OPEC output in February was ""well below""
  the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries
  are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency
  Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.
      The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the
  result ""of member countries' firm determination to defend the
  organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to
  refrain from selling any quantity below that price.""
      The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no
  OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session
  planned to start on June 25.
      The official gave no figure for February output. The
  statement said only that ""the reduction in total supplies,
  namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local
  deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as
  those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.""
      ""No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters
  to align the official selling price to the ongoing market
  price, member countries are, without exception, strictly
  adhering to the official selling price in spite of the
  financial hardship this may entail,"" the statement said.
      ""The very recent improvement in the price structure is an
  indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to
  the official selling price,"" the statement said.
      Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a
  barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official
  levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.
      There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might
  have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled
  June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some
  states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices
  each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main
  markets.
      The official said in the statement that no such emergency
  session was scheduled ""because of member countries' firm
  determination to defend the price (system)"" agreed in December.
      Opec""s differential committee was to have met in Vienna
  starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no

      The department had given its tentative approval of the

  service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the
  acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those
  markets by other carriers.
      The agency said Air North America provided no support for
  its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers
  monopoly power in some markets.
      The transportation agency said Air North America also

      However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of
  provisioning for loan losses established last year because of
  many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss
  provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.
      The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5
  mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic
  share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.
      Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used
  an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in
  calculating first quarter results.
      The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to
  172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.
      Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an

  213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income
  was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,
  non-interest expenses and income taxes.
      The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92
  billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly
  to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.
      Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100
  dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,
  but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.

2228,"BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT
  The Bank of England again fought against
  money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate
  cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
  in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.
      It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct
  of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued
  to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
  the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.
      Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can
  stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want
  to.
      The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants
  rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when
  it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to
  relieve a money market shortage.
      ""They're really making the discount houses suffer,"" said
  Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.
  ""Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.""
      This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
  any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had
  inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came
  strongly into the pound.
      The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London
  close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60
  marks, up from 2.8720/50.
      ""If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that
  rates could drop before the Budget,"" said Jeremy Hale, economist
  at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.
      Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the
  base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
      However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be
  convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating
  rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.
      There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said
  Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.
      Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
  a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and
  disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to
  hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
  for bonds, Fellner said.
      An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
  forecasts say it will be this year.
      Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
  oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.
      However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
  the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.
      The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
  rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.
      Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least
  a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term
  capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.
      They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
  than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and
  current political upheavals in Washington.
      The Bank may want to see another few points on the
  trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. ""But by
  then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of
  England,"" he added.
      The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
  pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources
  said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
  than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.
      Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
  harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that
  the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.
      This was above previous estimates of the current account
  deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.
      Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
  have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they
  were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.
      The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
  banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank
  officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this
  week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.
  If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point
  cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

  Japan is expected to cut the base lending
  rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
  part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
  Finance Ministry sources said.
      They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
  Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
  abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
  the bureau.
      The bureau channels funds to government financial
  institutions for public works and other official uses, they
  said.
      The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
  Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
  corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
  tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
      However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
  to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
  Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
      The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
  market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
  domestic economy, they said.
      On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
  their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
  The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
  using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
  Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
  the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
      These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
  should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
  the ministry sources said.
      Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
  percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

  Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistler
  said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International
  Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the
  best interests of both companies.
      ""Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
  good for both companies,"" Kistler said of the proposed merger
  that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service
  company. ""We're working very hard on this merger.""
      Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
  to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11
  to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.
      The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern
  about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would
  require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and
  submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
  terminate the proposed merger.
      The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two
  companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
  before signing the decree.
      The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the
  counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state
  court to force to Hughes to complete the merger.
      ""The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
  be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous
  about what the outcome might be,"" Kistler said, in explaining
  why Hughes had made the counter proposal.
      ""We need additional time to understand why Baker did not
  accept our proposal.""
      Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker ""was not
  a factor"" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
  on the table.
      He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
      Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a
  compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
      The Justice Department in January said it would block the
  Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
  companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
  for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
      The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because
  its was too ""unreasonable."" Hughes said that Baker should
  instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
  merger is finalized and given government approval.
      Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable
  buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
  approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
  finding a buyer.
      Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
  up to 10 years to complete the sales.
      He also expressed concern that the combined companies might
  be required by the government's conditions to license some of
  its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
      Baker said last night in a statement that the required
  assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
  representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
  companies.

  officials said.
      SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the
  leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,
  Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.
      Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share
  offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance
  Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.
      Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later
  this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the
  bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.
      SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated
  group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160
  mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.
      SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital
  increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln
  francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,
  giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
      The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in
  line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a
  regional operation, Geronimus said.
      He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around
  30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten
  pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees
  with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share
  reserved for foreign investors. ""This is too small an operation
  and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,"" he said.
      Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of
  120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.
      Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce
  its existing strong points, with no major projects planned
  apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.
      SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the

  Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw de

  as from July 1.
      Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not
  settled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.
      The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ,
  Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and
  added there was now no alternative to proceeding with
  redundancy plans.
      The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19
  in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from
  the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.
      Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked loss
  figures given for the port for this year.
      The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ,
  put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985
  at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around
  30 mln.
      The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and

  Striking Brazilian seamen, who say
  they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports,
  today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister
  Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said.
      Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National
  Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talks
  would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.
      Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.
      The union official said the strike had halted a total of
  158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, and
  about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro.
      Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain,
  Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.
      Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to
  the government, which has already had to suspend interest
  payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic
  deterioration in the country's trade balance.
      The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo
  Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantil
  newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships
  could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.
      ""Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is
  not conceivable that exports be hit,"" he said.
      ""But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are
  going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad,
  and all this through the fault of the seamen,"" Rubens Habbema
  said.
      A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the
  scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said
  movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its

  Tandem Computers Inc said it expects

  ending March 31 against a year ago.
      ""We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the
  quarter,"" James Treybig, president and and chief executive
  officer, told a meeting of securities analysts.
      In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned
  9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln
  dlrs.
      Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the
  quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for
  the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln
  dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is
  traditionally slower than the first.
      L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen
  estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per
  share. For the full year, he said he expects the computer maker
  to earn about 2.40 dlrs a share. In fiscal 1986, Tandem earned
  1.44 dlrs a share.
      Treybig, who founded the Cupertino, Calif.-based company,
  said he has seen a rebound in computer orders in the United
  States. ""The U.S. economy is picking up, and buying decisions
  are being made. We didn't see that a year ago,"" he said.
      The executive said Tandem will increase its research and
  development spending to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 87
  mln dlrs in fiscal 1986.
      He said the company plans to introduce several products,
  including two low-end systems and a data base that uses the SQL

  Kuwait""s Oil Minister, in remarks
  published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
  meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
  oil prices.
      Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
  daily al-Qabas as saying: ""None of the OPEC members has asked
  for such a meeting.""
      He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
  barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
  limits of the 13-nation organisation.
      Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
  OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
  bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
      They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
  the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
  quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
      ""This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
  Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
  because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the minister
  said.
      Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
  produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
      ""If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
  while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
  share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said.
      He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
  which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
  of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
  official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
  of 18 dlrs per barrel.
      Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
  this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
  19 dollars a barrel.
      Sheikh Ali also delivered ""a challenge to any international
  oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.""
      Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
  barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
      However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
  of its local and international refining facilities and its own
  distribution network abroad, he added.
      He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC""s
  differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
  April at the request of certain of the body""s members.
      Ecuador""s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
  last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
  a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
  talks this month of opec""s pricing committee.
      Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
  apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: ""We
  expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
  April."" But he expected the situation would later improve.

237,"INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE
  Indonesia appears to be nearing a
  political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
  economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
      To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
  launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
  boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
  investment.
      Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
  primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s
  fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
  currency by 31 pct in September.
      But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""s
  government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
  the economy.
      ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
  deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,""
  the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agricultural
  sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic
  performance.
      It says that while many government officials and advisers
  are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong
  pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.""
      ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,""
  the report says.
      Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
  Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
  though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
  steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
      Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
  which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
  restrictions and liberalised imports.
      The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986
  was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
  contracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since the
  mid-1960s,"" the report notes.
      Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
  population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
  April.
      But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
  in the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to a
  slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
  activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
  earnings from the petroleum industry.""
      ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
  domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
  declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
  growth in agriculture,"" the report states.
      Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
  crucial for the government to get the international lending its
  needs.
      A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
  of payments support was given partly to help the government
  maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

2375,"TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE>
  Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for
  USAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,
  which was being courted by USAir.
      Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4
  billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir
  takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to
  accepting the bid.
      Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
  said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
  takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.
      Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was
  off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
  it would be taken over.
      Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt
  to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a
  suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
     ""The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or
  Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,"" speculated one arbitrager.
      Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
  price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will
  succeed.
      Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk
  Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
  company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
  Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
      Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
  Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
  destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the
  least likely to be bought.
      Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
  the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a
  three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.
      But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's
  offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
  contingencies.
      Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
  airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.
      ""You can't discount him,"" said one arbitrager.
      Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is
  serious by following through with his threats or making a new
  offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go
  directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
  price if USAir rejected his offer.
      ""It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,"" said
  one arbitrager.
      Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
  about six dlrs per share.
      Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline
  combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
  others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
  acquired separately.
      ""TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
  work,"" said one analyst.
      Analysts said such a merger would be costly and
  complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn
  succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
      In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage
  scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,
  analysts said.
      Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they
  said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'
  costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a
  necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
      However, other analysts speculated the managements of
  Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new
  company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way
  for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged
  into TWA.

      The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr

      Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting

      Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was
  possible between the two giant oilfield service companies.

      ""Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the

  decree.

  of Baker and Hughes have scheduled any meetings to discuss the

2383,"OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING
  Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman
  said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd
  ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been
  delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec
  prices.
      Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from
  Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in
  February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were
  strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they
  were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official
  prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
      ""We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,""
  he said. ""I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they
  are committed to making the accord work,"" he said.
      Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He
  said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these
  figures.
      Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated
  that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he
  said; ""That could well be correct.""
      Opec""s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying
  group output was ""well below"" its ceiling in February. But it
  gave no figures.
      But one source close to Opec indicated that February output
  may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.
      The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around
  16 mln bpd.
      Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8
  mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.
      Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all
  produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said
  it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December
  pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.
      Lukman said that some industry reports ""may be correct"" that
  in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238
  mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln
  allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.
      He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his
  country were coming under price pressure because they were
  currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and
  the United States"" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.
      However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that
  demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons
  and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.
      ""We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is
  now firming on actual fundamentals,"" he said, adding that he
  expected it to go ""up and up"" even beyond official prices after
  early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand
  for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria""s.
      The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela
  and Indonesia were having less problems with output than
  producers like his own country because they exported oil
  products.
      Also, some of Venezuela""s heavy grades were outside the Opec
  pricing system, he said.
      Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift
  some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks
  and ran them down to ""dangerous levels,"" they would eventually
  have to buy Opec oil.
      ""When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)
  they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more
  later on,"" he said.
      Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being
  pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was
  important to know that terms with them were negotiable,
  flexible and under constant review, not only when the market
  seemed weak.
      He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation
  ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that
  such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority
  for Opec at the moment.
      ""At this time, we have to get our priorities right,"" he said.
  ""The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is
  working, not dealing with a differential of cents between
  grades.""
      But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over
  the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.

  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said
  large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the
  country's bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp
  recovery in the Canadian dollar.
      He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and
  the United States, is the result of ""confidence in the
  direction this country is going in.""
      ""That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is
  higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when
  it was) a little over 69 cts,"" Wilson told the House of Commons
  daily question period.
      Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a
  record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than
  double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5
  billion dlrs in the market.
      Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a
  possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment
  abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign
  companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from
  6.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
      The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would
  generate many new jobs in Canada.

  Top U.S. and European farm trade and
  government representatives called for a sweeping reform of
  world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
  imbalance.
      Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here
  demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for
  an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
  production.
      ""It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
  harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the
  disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of
  protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
  become more harmful,"" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy
  Administrator William Bailey said.
      Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which
  ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to
  adjust its policies to the changing market environment.
      The need for urgent reforms is justified by the ""imbalance
  and tensions of the world economy,"" the secretary general of the
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
  Jean-Claude Paye said.
      And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade, he noted.
      Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
  reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
  to help farmers in unprofitable areas.
      Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
  prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and
  instead help farmers through income support and adjustment
  aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of
  Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.
      Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take
  greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.
      However, ""differentiated policy treatment is required"" to
  take account of large disparities in the situation around the
  EC, he said.
      ""Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy
  and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
  Community,"" he said.

  Union Carbide Corp said its 1986

      The company released its audited 1986 results.
      The company also said its long term debt was reduced by
  about 1.5 billion dlrs from the third quarter to the end of the
  year by asset sales and equity offerings. Union Carbide sold
  its battery products, home and automobile products and
  agricultural products businesses in 1986. In the fourth
  quarter, it offered 30 mln shares of stock, raising about 650
  mln dlrs.
      The asset sales and equity offering were part of a
  recapitalization plan undertaken by the chemicals company last
  year.
      Audited net earnings in 1986 of 496 mln dlrs or 4.78 dlrs a
  share compared to a 1985 loss of 581 mln dlrs or 2.78 dlrs were
  unchanged from the company's preliminary earnings report made
  on Jan 28. The earnings results for the fourth quarter were
  also unchanged.
      Included in the 1986 numbers are a 564 mln dlr gain from
  sale of the different businesses, a 270 mln dlr pension credit
  and a charge of 473 mln dlrs from the purchase of long term
  debt at a premium under the recapitalization.
      In the audited results released today, the company broke
  down results by business segment.
      Operating profit in the fourth quarter for all of the
  company's operations on a consolidated basis, before corporate
  and interest expense and taxes, was 181 mln dlrs against a loss
  of three mln dlrs in the 1985 quarter.
      In the year, operating profit was 791 mln dlrs compared to
  a loss of 253 mln dlrs in 1985.
      In a statement, the company said it defeated a hostile
  takeover attempt, by GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, and recapitalized the
  company, adding, ""While all this was going on, our continuing
  businesses performed very soundly, with substantial operating
  profit improvement over 1985.""
      Carbon products posted operating profit of eight mln dlrs
  in the quarter, down from 29 mln dlrs, and 49 mln dlrs in the
  year against a loss of 146 mln dlrs.
      Chemicals and plastics had fourth quarter operating profit
  of 122 mln dlrs compared to a year-ago loss of 49 mln dlrs. In
  the year, chemicals and plastics earned 472 mln dlrs against
  losses of 142 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Operating income at industrial gases rose to 64 mln dlrs
  from 55 mln in the quarter and to 276 mln dlrs from 222 mln in
  the year.
      The company's specialties and services segment cut its
  losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in
  the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs.
      Eliminations of business conducted between the company's
  industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter
  1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The
  eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six
  mln dlrs in the year.
      The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual
  writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the
  quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year.
      Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501
  mln dlrs.
      By segment, spending at carbon products fell to 42 mln dlrs
  from 57 mln dlrs and spending fell at specialties and services

  The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
  slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
  announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
  deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
      The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
  in the last published budget for 1985/86.
      In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
  Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
  spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
      Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
  billion riyals.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
  6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
  projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
      The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
  uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
  decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
  one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
  pct.
      He urged heads of government departments and public
  institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
  did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
  1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
  the country's foreign reserves.
      He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
  allocated for major projects including housing and public
  buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
  communications, electricity and water, industry and
  agriculture.
      No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
  security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
      Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
  barrels per day.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: ""Our expectations of positive signs
  regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
  determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
  wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
  year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.""

  Gulf money markets have grown reasonably
  well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain
  to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf
  International Bank BSC> (GIB) said.
      The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf
  capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional
  investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank
  accounts and precious metals.
      ""Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with
  more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the
  disclosure requirements on company accounts,"" he said.
      The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three
  categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.
      Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of
  short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had
  floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.
      ""Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large
  extent, fragmented and lagging behind,"" he said.
      Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans
  and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of
  stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock
  exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish
  exchanges.
      But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,
  governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital
  markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.
      He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had
  ""clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital
  markets in the region.""
      In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,
  financial awareness among investors is still lacking and
  investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack
  depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted
  investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.
      Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some
  Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt
  financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.
      He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation
  of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.
      Azzam said capital market instruments should be made
  available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation
  Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi
  Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been
  taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to
  own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.
      Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth
  from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and
  the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi
  Arabia.
      But he added there is ""no bond market to speak of"" in Saudi
  Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal
  denominated bond issued in 1978.
      While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading
  in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal
  exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,
  Azzam said.

2475,"HUGHES &lt;HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT
  A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed
  Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a
  proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>, Wall
  Street analysts said.
      Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was
  off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from
  Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said
  it was still interested in the merger.
      The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its
  troubles could make it a takeover candidate.
      There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas
  investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters
  he is not interested.
      Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities
  and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in
  some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the
  target other than to rule out Hughes.
      One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes
  turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of
  Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the
  Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.
      Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a
  merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,
  analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was
  going.
      ""I think the merger is not going through,"" said Phil Pace,
  analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger ""lost a
  lot of its appeal"" when the U.S. Department of Justice required
  that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.
      Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of
  the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said ""30 to 40
  pct of the cost savings are tied up in that.""
      ""They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,""
  said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
  ""Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but
  whether they will alter their position, I don't know.
      ""It's getting a little confusing,"" said James Carroll,
  analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited
  by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger ""tend to be weak.""
  Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it
  wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,
  the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer
  period of time.
      Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the
  companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker
  apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.
      Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln
  dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling
  Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be
  saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.
      Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first
  signed ""the outlook for the industry has improved materially.""
  Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry
  is lifting.

  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
  accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
  official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
      Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
  oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia ""is fully adhering by the
  ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
  pronounced prices under any circumstance.""
      Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market
  prices ""may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
  winter season and the glut in the market.""
      Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,
  under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
  7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
  prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
      The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,
  which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
  mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices
  are currently just over 16 dlrs.
      Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's
  adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
      He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all
  wanted to stick to the accord.
      In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also
  Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the
  pricing agreement.
      ""We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate
  the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the
  fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,"" he said.
      Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said
  in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were
  no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.
      Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
  OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.
      They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
  the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
  quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.

  ChemLawn Corp said its board
  rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer
  and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.
      ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial
  advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other
  purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.
      ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or
  ""poison pill,"" during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board
  adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any
  means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other
  purchasers.
      ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
  Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
  other relief.
      The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
  Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
  before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
  possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
  Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
      Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
  ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
      ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
  was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
  and could ""adversely affect"" the interests of its employees,
  suppliers, creditors, and customers.
      ""Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
  concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
  company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
  shares to Waste Management,"" said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
      ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
  shareholders against abusive tactics, such as ""market
  accumulations by Waste Management or others.""
      Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
  distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
  common.
      ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
  common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its

      It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
  they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
  board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
  prior to their exercise date.

      The company also reached agreements in principle for an 8.1

      About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will be
  provided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement is
  contingent on court approval after notice to class members, it
  said.
       The criminal case settlement dismisses all charges
  including bribery and false statement, except for conspiracy to
  which Paradyne pleaded guilty.
      The criminal settlement includes the lifting of the
  government's suspension, the dismissal of the federal civil
  false claims suit and all charges against the individuals.
      Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide for
  the civil settlement, 750,000 dlrs will go to settle a
  derivative lawsuit.
      For the year ended December 31, Paradyne reported a net
  loss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mln
  dlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs to
  cover the civil and criminal settlements announced today.
      Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president and
  chief executive officer, succeeding Robert Wiggins who resigned
  as chairman and chief executive officer as part of the
  settlement of the indictment.
      Kendall formerly served as executive vice president and
  chief operating officer.
      The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace,
  it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but is
  optimistic about the outlook for the year.
      For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net
  income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs.
      Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were
  charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal
  indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne
  in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security
  Administration.
      The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government
  officials and defaud the Social Security Administration.
  Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing
  false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and
  Exchange Commission investigation.
   
     Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors
  agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other
  defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement.

  successfully complete the probation period. Details of the

      The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota
  of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to
  Norbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been
  signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required
  liftings.
      The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on
  Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2
  mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices
  apparently cut February production.
      It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the
  Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and
  0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal
  consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.
      The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in
  February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and
  47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.
      The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd
  OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids
  (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other
  developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd
  with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of
  non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal)
  and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.
      Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record
  1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected
  in February in accordance with government curtailments of
  approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

      Under federal law, it cannot buy more than 15 pct of
  Comdata's stock until a 15 to 30 day waiting period is over,

  in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of
  the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters.
      The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have
  rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company
  Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of
  Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).

  resolving the dispute.
      He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands,
  Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.
      Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to
  the government, which has suspended interest payments on part
  of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in
  the country's trade balance.

  Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange
  auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since
  January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.
      ""We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been
  abolished at all,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
      He said the system would be reintroduced after current
  talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
  and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.
      Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction
  system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private
  bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.
      Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the
  government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.
      It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and
  strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible
  for the government and the private sector, he said.
      Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The
  kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.
  In January 1987 the government was more than two months in
  arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and
  the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange
  rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

  Dome Petroleum Ltd's 23.2 pct stake of

  right price,"" spokesman David Annesley said in response to an
  inquiry.
      Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman Howard
  Macdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling its
  stake in Dome Mines.
      Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy
  Corp Ltd>, Annesley said ""Encor is a strategic investment for
  Dome, and we have no intention of selling it.""
      Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that
  he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the
  sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.
      He also declined to specify at what price the company would
  consider selling it shares.
      ""Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of
  Dome Mines stock) are very attractive,"" Annesley commented.
      ""We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time
  when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs,"" he added. A
  price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered ""fairly
  attractive,"" Annesley said.
      Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome
  Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. ""There might be an
  opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be
  virtually a control block in Dome Mines,"" he said.
      Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on
  the Toronto Stock Exchange.
      Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure
  debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56
  major creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.
      The company previously said it expects to detail the plan

  Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken> banking group
  said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan
  collateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST> founder and former chief
  executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.
      The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --
  was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.
      The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's
  unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.
  Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for
  the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.
      The statement said the sale did not represent any
  withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta
  group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main
  shareholders.
      Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans
  of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which
  last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve
  its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main
  shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln
  crowns until a new equity issue could be made.
      Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'
  meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.
      Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown
  loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.
      Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln
  crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra
  170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and
  shareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner
  &lt;Industrivarden AB>.
      The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been
  doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this
  week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the
  company was in a much worse state than he thought.

2725,"BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES
  This week's Bank of England resistance to
  strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
  holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
      But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
  Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
  broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
  said.
      Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
  trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
  Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
      Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
      A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
  a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
  therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
      Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
  Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
  trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. ""Even after this action
  over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
  distance of that range,"" he said.
      Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
  broad target range around this area.
      However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
  pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
  a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
      ""If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
  are, what's to stop it (going higher),"" said John Cox, executive
  director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
  foreign exchange market.
      Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
  selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
  general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
  keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
      The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
  1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
      But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
  heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
  holds around these levels.
      He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
  rate boat. ""If rates don't come down, the market will say they
  ought to have come down and will sell sterling,"" he said.
      Most dealers agree there is a good deal of ""hot money"" being
  invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
  or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
  notice.
      However, the authorities will hope that at least a
  proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
      ""The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
  have to jack them back up again,"" said Richard Jeffrey,
  economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
      He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
  sterling, at least in the near term.
      However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
  about March 17, Budget Day.
      The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
  Budget, said Temperton.
      The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
  run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
  bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
      ""Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
  He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
  cut,"" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
  equities arm of Mercury International Group.
      Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
  way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
  the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
  Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
      This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
  3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
  since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
      However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
  money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
  as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.

273,"SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD
  Saudi crude oil output last month fell
  to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
  in January, Gulf oil sources said.
      They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
  terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
  from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
  customers.
      But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
  exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
  from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
      The production figures include neutral zone output but not
  sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
  part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
      Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
  production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
  last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
  a barrel.
      The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
  appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
  entitlements before the month-end.
      Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
  support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
  customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
      The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc
  &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement
  last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
      However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
  ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
  come this month, when demand for petroleum products
  traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
  weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
      Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
  reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
  and said it would never sell below official prices.
      The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
  slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
  January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
  refineries.
      They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
  last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
  Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
  at around 200,000 bpd each.

  Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS>
  chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase
  in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was
  encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.
      Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release
  of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign
  earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,
  notably in the securities business.
      He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10
  share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.
      News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share
  price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.
      Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the
  future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and
  ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.
      Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986
  by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1
  pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.
      Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings
  margins via traditional lending activities, he said.
      Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk
  provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly
  concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor
  which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank
  stocks recently.
      He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially
  troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin
  American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.
      He added that losses incurred through loans to tin
  producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had
  been written off.

2775,"CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL
  U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 
  dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price
  could rise another dollar as inventories fall.
      ""OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market
  there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time
  to major refining centers,"" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst
  with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. ""That could send prices
  50 cts to a dollar higher,"" he added.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to
  18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.
      The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in
  February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a
  barrel.
      ""Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that
  oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its
  15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come
  under question,"" McKinley said.
      Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly
  report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in
  industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during
  the first quarter of this year.
      IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first
  quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose
  inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln
  tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.
      Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd
  draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday
  fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.
      Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a
  so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying
  officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization
  to offer discounts to the official price.
      ""This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the
  ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively
  soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),""
  the general trading manager of an international oil company
  told Reuters in a telephone interview.
      For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting
  excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own
  output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to
  be 14.7 mln bpd this week.
      Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend
  oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.
      ""This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000
  bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,
  the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting
  it to be there,"" McKinley said.
      International oil traders said that other short-haul
  crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian
  refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily
  available Mideast crudes earlier this week.
      If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up
  the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading
  managers at several companies told Reuters.
      But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long
  OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.
      Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity
  Management, said OPEC production was lower ""because of the
  Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it
  gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.""
       He added, ""The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other
  members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the
  Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low
  as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,"" he added.
      There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the
  spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.
      Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery
  into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which
  traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of
  18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.
      Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far
  East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.
      ""There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government
  deals, which are below official prices and this is probably
  being resold,"" one international trader said.

      Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln

      Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the
  transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by
  shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide
  before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.
      Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed
  Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing
  concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.
      Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review
  beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations
  and warranties are true.
      Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information
  which would make its representations and warranties untrue.
      Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The
  65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset.

  all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln
  dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year
  on the anniversary date of the transaction.
      He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added
  to the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months.
      Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit
  Siemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of

  ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting

      The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending

      The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's
  motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against
  Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.
      In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to
  Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the

      Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the
  company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for
  December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views
  concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting
  power of substantial Lucky stockholders.
      Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,
  last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.
      Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring
  program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own

2792,"ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS
  American Telephone and Telegraph Co's
  proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is
  unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it
  should help the company's profits, analysts said.
      ""Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large
  volume users, but status quo for residential users,"" said
  PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.
      But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has
  constrained the company's profits in the long distance
  business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.
      ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance
  business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated
  rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut
  last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.
      Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal
  Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount
  of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to
  its competitors to oppose it filings.
      MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing
  yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition
  in the telephone business.
      Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in
  the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins
  previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said
  they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in
  the industry, simply because of the competition the phone
  industry giant faces.
      ""You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,""
  said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. ""But you wouldn't
  see a rise."" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to
  selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. ""It
  will give ATT a lot more flexibility,"" he said.
      ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of
  companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC
  hearings.
      It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the
  long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United
  Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>.
      ""We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a
  reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it,"" a U.S.
  Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed
  to greater competition.
      It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,
  and in the process they may be altered by the various
  constituencies affected by the move.
      ""There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much
  bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it
  won't happen that fast,"" said analyst Victor Krueger of the

2833,"DOME PETE&lt;DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR
  Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
  from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of
  Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
  energy industry analysts said.
      Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
  part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
  mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
  pay down debt, analysts said.
      ""The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
  direction that might make it a saleable asset,"" said one analyst
  who asked not to be named.
      Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
  Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
  Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale ""at
  the right price.""
      Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
  billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
  it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
  Encor shares do not pay dividends.
      A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
  whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
      At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
  valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
  shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
      Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
  prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
  Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
      ""Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
  recent weeks with a runup in crude prices,"" Peters and Co Ltd
  oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
      ""The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
  sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
  they have been able to in recent years,"" he added.
      Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
  7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
  dlrs in early February.
      The company also recently set up its own operating
  management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
  Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
      Dome and Encor ""are actually going to get farther apart. So
  (the sale) does make a lot of sense,"" Mote said.
      However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
  Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
  proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
  Commerce Bank.
      ""I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
  they can,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
      Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
  block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
      ""Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
  something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
  sold out from under them,"" said analyst Gobert.
      Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
  liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
  Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
      Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
  possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
      Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
  debt and has a ""right of consent"" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
  holding.
      Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
  would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
  obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
  price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
  but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share ""are very
  attractive.""

  USAir Group said it sought the help

  with Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to order
  TWA to sell its USAir shares.
      ""What they have done is in direct violation of the Federal
  Aviation Act,"" USAir said.
      It said TWA week filed a cursory application with the
  Department of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65
  billion dlr takeover of USAir.
      USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Department
  of Transportation to dismiss the application.
      USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoided
  pre-merger notification requirements, and also did not provide
  a competitive and public interest analysis required under
  regulations.
      USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would be
  limited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding
  shares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10
  pct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir's
  stock.
      TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings to
  more than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding.

  As a British government investigation got
  under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free
  Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had
  already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.
      Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary
  investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry
  capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to
  leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.
      Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks
  through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend
  Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.
      Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the
  Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned
  to pull them out of service at present.
      ""Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait
  and see. But it is too early to say what happened,"" he told BBC
  radio.
      As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged
  hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts
  had already been expressed about the design of so-called ""RoRo""
  ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.
      In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime
  Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on
  roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck
  areas divided by bulkheads.
      Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German
  yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety
  standards.
      But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would
  have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its
  design.
      Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley
  said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to
  a barge.
      ""As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out
  of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is
  compartmentalised and you have more stability,"" he said.
      Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly
  stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.
      ""If you do get water into that area then you can get very
  severe effects on the stability of the ship,"" he added.

      The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,

2973,"ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL
  The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
  shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
  least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
      The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
  repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
  jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
  It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
  the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
  Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
  days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
      The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
  12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
  pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
  accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
  60 pct of government revenues.
      Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
  of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
  about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
  above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
  Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
  173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
      However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
  costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
  pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
  about 60 days to build.
      Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
  had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
  of January, about equal to one month's imports.

2979,"GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS
  Increased federal government borrowing
  needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy
  mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds
  higher this year, bond market sources say.
      ""At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term
  rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly
  on foreigners,"" one portfolio manager for a large securities
  investment house in Frankfurt said.
      The sources also said the government had already stepped up
  its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.
      Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the
  sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six
  pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.
      This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct
  coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.
      But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract
  foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
  push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
      Sources noted federal government issues had also increased
  in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume
  only starting last May.
      One finance ministry economist said ""It isn't more. It's
  just the size (of each bond) which has increased."" He added
  conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly
  favourable for raising new debt.
      Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,
  with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.
      With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,
  foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as
  hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.
      Sources said the government has may have already stepped up
  its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.
      The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in
  1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing
  through bonds was 26.6 billion.
      The sources said this indicated a move by the government
  out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds
  through the more acceptable loan stock form.
      Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large
  amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including
  the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
  income next year. ""The problem here will be the tax reform,"" the
  portfolio manager said.
      He added that the government's cut in its top income tax
  rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for
  the government to reduce borrowings.
      The sources said the government would fall far short of
  covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the
  tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to
  fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.
      The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
  government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen
  back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the
  issue of fixed-rate medium-term ""Kassenobligation"" notes.
      A finance ministry economist said the government did not
  expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a
  net 22.3 billion marks this year.
      Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would
  probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come
  into effect.
      ""I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would
  mean government borrowing will increase,"" the manager said.
      Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with
  the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation
  falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
      But sources said foreign demand for the new federal
  government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the
  dollar may now rise against the mark.
      ""The demand wasn't so good,"" a dealer for a German bank in
  London said.
      The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark
  even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds
  recently, some dealers said.

  Japanese customers have bought nearly six
  mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company
  (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and
  Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese
  traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.
      NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese
  customers with different formulas. One company has bought
  800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of
  30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.
      Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and
  Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.
  
      Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to
  reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot
  markets, oil traders said.
      Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder
  weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was
  below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.
      Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish
  sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market
  are supporting spot price levels, they said.
  
      Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price
  but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a
  discount, the sources said. ""It's just disguised cheating,"" one
  Japanese trader said.
      The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the
  official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln
  barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in
  Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have
  been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the

  started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,
  and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has
  unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights
  are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be
  followed by a merger at the same price.
      USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to
  buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.
  Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.
      USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough
  shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont
  on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of
  Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
  buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain
  control of Piedmont.
      The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont
  provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's

      In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of

  Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
  a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
  secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the
  companies at the core of their business empire.
      A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
  Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
  over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
  pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
      Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which
  Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
  price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
      Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
  424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
  rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
  the free shares.
      The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
  49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
  while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
  and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
      The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
  amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
      The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
  mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
  expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
  to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
      The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
  and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
  &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
  &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.
      Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
  shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and
  Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
      Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
  managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
  company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.
      During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
  building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
  any raid on the heart of their business empire.
      But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
  electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small
  at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
  speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
  interests to protect its core activities.

  &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, a company
  formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer
  for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.
      In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and
  withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.
      Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln
  of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and
  is Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in
  Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono
  Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>,
  which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.
      For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World
  earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from
  earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a
  year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0
  mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.
      MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
  enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully
  diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy
  all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and
  approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the
  NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.
      MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM> has committed to
  lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best
  efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing
  for the transaction.
      It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>,
  has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is
  highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475
  mln dlrs in ""mezzanine"" financing.
      MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New
  Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,
  since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.
      In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World
  board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September
  1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of &lt;Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital
  Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise
  his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.
      Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and
  chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that ""The decision to go
  directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may
  financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the
  lack of responsiveness of the management in the past.""
      Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express
  his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder
  values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board
  seat.  ""My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,
  you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer
  rather than giving it serious consideration,"" he said.
      Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be
  willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.
      ""As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe
  operating management of the company has performed well and that
  appropriate consideration should be given to a significant
  equity interest for them in the company following the
  acquisition,"" Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.
      MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as
  the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
  to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election
  or removal of directors.

3048,"ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL
  The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
  shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
  least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
      The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
  repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
  jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
  It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
  the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
  Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
  days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
      The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
  12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
  pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
  accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
  60 pct of government revenues.
      Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
  of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
  about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
  above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
  Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
  173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
      However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
  costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
  pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
  about 60 days to build.
      Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
  had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
  of January, about equal to one month's imports.
      It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
  dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
  total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
  Latin America.
      In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
  loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
  months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
      Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
  and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
  repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
      A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
  Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
  and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
  Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
  co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

  family.""
      He added that the accord would allow Renault and Chrysler
  to study the development of future products destined to be
  distributed by Renault and Chrysler in the North American and
  world markets.
      ""Renault is a leader in our industry and I am happy to be

      Chrysler will pay for Renault's AMC interests held in bonds
  by a 200 mln dlr bond and will pay up to 350 mln dlrs for
  Renault share interests, depending on AMC sales and future
  profits, the Renault statement said.
      The statement said the agreement in principle gave each
  side 30 days to put together a definitive accord. Approval
  would also be necessary from the Renault, Chrysler and AMC
  boards, from AMC shareholders and the relevant government
  authorities.
      If the deal goes ahead, the statement said, AMC
  shareholders other than Renault will receive Chrysler shares
  for each of their shares valued at four dlrs.
      AMC shareholders with convertible preferential shares will
  have the possibility to exchange them for Chrysler shares on
  the same conditions as those they would have had in exchanging

3062,"SOUTHERN &lt;SO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST
  Southern Co said it will take an
  after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than
  January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear
  power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers
  in Georgia will be asked to pay.
      The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said
  the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln
  dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made
  last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased
  cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric
  rates.
      Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled
  completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September
  1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.
      The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit
  One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power
  tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a
  full-power license.
      The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is
  co-owned by &lt;Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric
  Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.
      Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was
  due to several factors, including additional labor costs
  incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for
  commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the
  first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it
  was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.
      In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would
  ""cap"" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay
  at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected
  8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power
  said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.
      Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is
  313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge
  against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.
      In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts
  with the joint owners require the utility to buy back
  significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's
  initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it
  will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase
  that applies to the buybacks.
      This bings the total amount that must be charged against
  earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.
      Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting
  Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require
  any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged
  against earnings once that determination is made.
      The company also said its board has approved a capital
  budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the
  Vogtle project.
      It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year
  period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting
  this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years
  1986-1988.

3078,"STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES
  A free trade pact between the United
  States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides
  substantially, according to a study released by the Institute
  for International Economics.
      The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion
  to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's
  gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.
  export's by about seven pct.
      He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of
  government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and
  investments and pave the way for new global talks under the 
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
      The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest
  trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150
  billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They
  are aiming for a pact by next October.
      Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of
  Maryland, said an agreement should include:
      - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased
  in over a five to 10-year period;
      - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two
  countries, replacing current ""Buy America"" and ""Buy Canada""
  provisions with a ""Buy North America"" provision;
      - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance
  and transportation;
      - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor
  domestic producers;
      - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.
       Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the
  two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to
  2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.
      The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.
      He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset
  subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for
  resolution at an early stage.
      Wonnacott said ""bilateral free trade would contribute to the
  efficiency of the North American economies and to their
  competitiveness in facing overseas producers.
      He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian
  goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass
  production.
      Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to
  Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large
  U.S. gross national product.
      Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas
  as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission
  could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write
  new and more liberal global trading regulations.

  The Bank of England said it was taking
  onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct
  Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on
  application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct
  and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the
  remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the
  bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free
  of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated
  8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 ""B.""  A further 100 mln stg was
  reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.
      The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's
  announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08
  quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20
  minutes after the news.
      Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the
  backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates
  which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of
  sterling's strength.
      The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
  see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon
  announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11
  pct.
      The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate
  cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay
  a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March
  17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.
      However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable
  climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
  allow a half-point cut.
      Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
  as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
  rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.
      Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
  foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
  of the budget, although one or two said they would not be
  surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.
      Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts
  last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued
  a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
  Government bond market.
      To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold
  out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
  market pushed on to register further sharp gains.
      Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
  issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
  rapidly as last week's.
      However, they noted that although sterling had edged down
  from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed
  on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final
  71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300
  GMT.

3115,"PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS
  Petro-Canada, Canada's
  state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation
  wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore
  Newfoundland.
      Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work
  should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development
  plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.
      Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,
  construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as
  early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.
      ""We have a high degree of confidence that the western
  portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln
  cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,
  and that we could produce it economicly using a floating
  production system,"" Petro-Canada said.
      The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.
  John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was
  discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.
      ""We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of
  the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up
  additional reserves there,"" the company said.
      Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial
  prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources
  towards development so it can start generating a return on
  investments, Petro-Canada said.
      Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,
  has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of
  the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East
  Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field
  participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,
  Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium
  Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.
      Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's
  Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,
  company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary
  office.
      Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East
  Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,
  he added.
      Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs
  to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the
  development budget could double if the company builds a
  production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.
      Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block
  would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily
  production, with a production system that would have maximum
  capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in
  answer to a query.
      The company estimates a production system combining both
  Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could
  produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.

3192,"WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR
  The World Bank intends to bring
  borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it
  expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank
  vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.
      He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,
  West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. ""The weight
  of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher
  probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower
  interest rates,"" he said.
      The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far
  this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.
      The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a
  level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and
  how much to borrow, Rotberg said.
      Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'
  anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding
  debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.
      Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it
  did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the
  sake of innovation, Rotberg said.
      Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some
  eight billion had been swapped into another currency.
      Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or
  unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that
  this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.
      The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over
  the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,
  for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new
  instruments such as bonds with warrants.
      The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany
  since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

  U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mln

      It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation
  claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before
  it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged,
  said David Larner of Lloyds.

  Thoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam
  Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.
      The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with

      Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard
  Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several
  shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also
  underwritten by Lloyds and other companies.
      Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to
  total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the
  normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974
  of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death.
      Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could

  Two new eurosterling bonds were launched
  today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this
  month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market
  fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria.
      The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in
  banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this
  had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from
  the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments.
      ""Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and
  we're set to see many more eurosterling deals,"" one dealer said.
      Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg
  deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by
  Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible
  deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. ""We
  thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we
  had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down
  with 10 already,"" one eurosterling specialist said.
      ""Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much
  more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a
  cheap and attractive way to raise your money,"" he added.
      This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have
  tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the
  Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including
  Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.
      Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current
  vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last
  month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields.
      A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at
  Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest.
      This is the first entry into the long term international

  removing several government policies that hinder investments in
  new prospects.
      DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished
  immediately and current proposals for increased environmental
  regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not
  adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife
  Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil
  companies, DiBona said.
      ""This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the
  nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil,"" DiBona
  said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while
  consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported
  oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.

  Chicago Board of Trade (CBT)
  agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a
  period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes
  ahead with planned renovation.
      A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a
  number of options to identify the most cost effective and
  efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve
  moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the
  nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.
      ""One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has
  been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,""
  the spokesman said.
      Another CBT official, executive vice president George
  Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a
  special meeting on the exchange floor.
      A number of presentations have been made with regard to
  renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. ""We've
  looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such
  things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,"" he added.
      It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we
  might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT
  markets, Sladoje said.
      ""If we move out of one floor entirely, then the
  construction period will be about a year,"" he said, adding that
  the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then
  be on the drawing board for eight months to a year.
      The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very
  preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until
  this summer at the earliest.
      In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits,
  exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary
  home next door in the present grains-dominated area.
      This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond
  futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and
  T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the
  MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat,
  soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options.
      Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT
  members.
      One senior floor trader said the financial futures room
  badly needs renovating.
      ""There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and
  the financials will move to the grains area,"" he said.
      The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was
  to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a
  time. ""The first step, after deciding the most effective way to
  proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering
  drawings,"" he said.
      He added that it was difficult at present to determine an
  exact time frame for any possible moves. ""This is a major
  undertaking and a process that would spread out over next
  year,"" he said.
      Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which
  merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing
  to vacate their floor at the end of this month.
      Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by
  moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved
  for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share
  their trading area.
      The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains,
  livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as
  some options contracts.
      ""Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here
  because the bonds are too crowded,"" one MidAm trader said.
      Another source at the MidAm said this change could take
  place by July or August.

  Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of
  American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,
  including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in
  American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.
      They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782
  mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.
      The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing
  Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's
  agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln
  dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not
  included valuing the transaction.
      Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed
  purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the
  transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in
  Chrysler's earnings.
      A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told
  Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it
  would have been had a deal been struck last year because the
  impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to
  assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards
  accumulated from its losses since 1980.
      ""There were very serious discussions last fall but we
  didn't pull it off,"" the source said in a reference to the
  assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges
  Besse.
      ""It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.
  And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done
  it before the end of last year.""
      In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the
  source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from
  lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called ""an overhang
  to the company.""
      Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that
  the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal
  in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln
  dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25
  mln dlrs in cash for ""transaction fees"" in connection with the
  acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid
  AMC shareholders.
      ""The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,""
  analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.
       Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12
  billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.
       But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's
  liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC
  debt that is being carried at ""non-market"" rates.
      He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the
  previous Renault management on the acquisition because they
  were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an
  integral part.
      ""The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't

      The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
  whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
  for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
  stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
      Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
  the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
  reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
      ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese
  government official said. ""But we are also frustrated.""
      The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
  18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
  spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
  That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
  but it will, he said.
      He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
  that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
  remain when it talks with Congress.
      ""It would only take five minutes to list their
  accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied.
      The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
  economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
  bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
  billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
      On the following two days, the topics will range from
  multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
  problems as super computers.
      The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
  discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
  savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
  housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
      These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
  Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
  pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
  stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
      Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
  boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
      Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
  U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
  imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
  buying more imports.
      Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
  trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
  trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one
  Japanese official said.
      That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
  bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
      Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
  trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
  access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
  action by the U.S., Officials said.
      Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
  bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
  overhanging them.
      ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted.
      As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
  about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
  super computers.
      The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
  super computer market.
      The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to

  sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up
  informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential

  The search continued for a

  Friday.
      A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were
  loaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, but
  Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a
  further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution.
      A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the
  front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.
      Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the
  wreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now lies
  partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour.
      The ferry's owner is &lt;European Ferries Plc>, majority owned
  by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.
      The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after
  divers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said it
  could take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodies
  estimated to be trapped amid debris.
      ""The problem is that in these waters you can normally expect
  one working day out of four,"" said Daan Kaakebeen of Dutch
  Salvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. He
  estimated the job itself would require 35 working days.
      Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raise

      Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss of
  the ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channel

  There is little chance Soviet exports

3446,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS
  Japanese microchip makers are being
  strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on
  semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's
  market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.
      But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring
  the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether
  the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any
  breathing space, they said.
      U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September
  have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese
  chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.
      ""MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry
  to get things done,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate
  vice president Peter Wolffe.
      Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the
  January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive
  chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject
  to the pact's price controls.
      The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide
  distributors with certificates designating them as authorised
  exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey
  marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.
      U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in
  jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets
  and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.
      But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the
  production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp
  said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.
      ""NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's
  demands,"" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. ""Once
  NEC cuts production, it means they all have.""
      Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese
  firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that
  the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.
      ""The best way to lower cost is to produce more,"" said Salomon
  Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.
      Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also
  spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt
  Aizawa said.
      Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new
  restrictions, some industry officials said.
      ""It's like tax avoidance schemes,"" said Steve Donovan, head
  of MMI Japan K.K. ""As soon as you close one route, another
  opens.""
      MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier
  shrugged off MITI guidance.
      ""It's getting to be like communism,"" said one.
      But analysts said output cuts could help by making it
  easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing
  firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.
      ""They're going to have to start running their businesses
  like businesses,"" Bache's Wolffe said.
      MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign
  urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry
  officials said response has been mixed at best.
      ""There has been some change, but it's not across the board,""
  said one U.S. Spokesman. ""The companies have a varying degree of
  urgency.""
      The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the
  troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.
      Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic
  random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition
  to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.
      Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory
  chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they
  said.
      Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.
  Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the
  most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.
      Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.
  Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.
      ""The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't
  even have an office here,"" a source close to the industry said.
  ""You could question just how committed they are.""
      In addition, some industry analysts question the
  effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third
  country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.
      ""(South) Korea's gaining market share,"" said one analyst.
  ""They're the real winners from the agreement.""

      His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television
  news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make

      King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared
  to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln
  barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price
  agreed to by OPEC last December.
      The King replied: ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by
  itself but certainly desires price stability.""
      Non-OPEC countries ""must help us in a framework of common
  interest so that there is no type of competition which could
  prove harmful to everyone,"" he said.
      Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first
  step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not
  for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such
  issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher
  benchmark.
      In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,
  due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd
  said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was
  adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which
  set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.

3490,"ULTRAMAR SAYS FOURTH QUARTER SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS
  Ultramar Plc &lt;UMAR.L> said that while
  its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point
  of view, several special charges adversely affected results.
      Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream
  operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and
  downstream operations also affected in the first half by large
  losses on inventories.
      But margins improved in the second half and in particular
  refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good
  recovery.
      The company was commenting on results that showed a net
  loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in
  1985.
      The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg
  provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled
  by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid
  natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership
  of Gulf Canada's marketing assets.
      Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a
  further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a
  withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a
  13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its
  U.S. Flag shipping operation.
      The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain
  although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase
  in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic
  prices would strengthen over the longer term.
      Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put
  it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.
      In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve
  profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while
  strengthening core businesses and developing a sound
  operational and financial base.
      Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled
  about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.
      Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from

  A spokesman for Preussag
  AG &lt;PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company
  would pay a dividend on 1986 results
      He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said
  results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has
  frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986
  following a difficult year in 1985.
      Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in
  December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not
  dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the
  final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.
      The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared
  with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and
  shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in
  the group's other divisions.
      The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic
  group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend
  partly on the level of provisions.
      Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine
  marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped
  to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.
      The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks
  in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.
  Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.
      The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by
  unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by
  poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.
      The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter
  of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an
  additional factor behind the drop in results.
      Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced
  would not begin to take full effect until this year.
      Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion
  marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first
  time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its
  majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.
      Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone
  was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison
  figures.
      Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0
  pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose
  to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.
      Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)
  subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group
  accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of
  last year.
      AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the
  international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world
  group losses that year.

  Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from
  3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion
  marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's
  securities repurchase agreement, dealers said.
      But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.
      A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,
  payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of
  mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the
  Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System
  (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks
  built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.
      The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion
  marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as
  an earlier securities repurchase pact matured.
      Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six
  billion marks.
      The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said
  yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll
  over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to
  redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.
      Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,
  but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.
      Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled
  53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the
  first nine days of March.
      Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected
  requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of
  funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet
  the requirement toward the end of March.
      No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week,
  but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if
  conditions significantly tighten. ""The Bundesbank wants to keep
  rates around 3.80 pct,"" one dealer said.

3534,"U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN
  The U.S. is urging reluctant
  commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel
  Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes
  the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt
  strategy, a Reagan administration official said.
      The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas
  for interest rate concessions should be treated much more
  seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing
  nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.
      In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to
  reconsider the idea of a ""megabank,"" where Third World debt would
  be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such
  a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the
  same time, however, the official expressed reservations that
  such a scheme would ever get off the ground.
      The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine
  suggestions that ""exit bonds"" be issued to end the troublesome
  role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to
  underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,
  the official said in an interview with Reuters.
      ""All of these things would fit within the definition of our
  initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and
  unique approach such as those should be considered,"" said the
  official, who asked not to be named.
      In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy
  under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such
  as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.
      In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact
  economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.
      ""The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors
  have been performing well,"" said the official. But he admitted
  that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an
  exception.
      The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.
  Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,
  also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve
  their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.
      ""We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications
  to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more
  effectively,"" the official said.
      Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that
  commercial banks create a ""megabank"" which could swap Third World
  debt paper for so-called ""exit bonds"" for banks like regional
  American or European institutions.
      Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to
  lend money to their former debtors every time a new money
  package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in
  its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.
      He emphasised that the ""megabank"" was not an administration
  plan but ""something some people have suggested.""
      Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are
  examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third
  World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would
  differ slightly from the one the official described.
      But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan
  would work in the United States.
      ""If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,
  fine. I don't think they ever will.""
      He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World
  loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant
  to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.
      Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under
  which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no
  more than 5/8 pct above Libor.
      ""The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite
  unique and I don't think it's something that should be
  categorically rejected out of hand,"" the official said.
      Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be
  offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin
  above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment
  Notes.
      These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a
  six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before
  maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point
  over Libor.
      Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too
  low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at
  stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and
  granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled
  debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support
  in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last
  year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.
      But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate
  capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the
  banks. ""It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you
  have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed
  before,"" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to
  be granted the rate concessions they seek. ""Some people argue
  that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really
  is is narrowing the spread on new money,"" he added.
      He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an
  initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.

3535,"POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION
  Interest in the currency futures market
  has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially
  explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental
  and Japanese currencies, analysts said.
      The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past
  week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the
  dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom.
      ""Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and
  technically, the pound is in the best shape,"" PaineWebber
  analyst Jason Gillard said.
      ""We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and
  we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,""
  Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said.
      Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark
  futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were
  liquidated yesterday, Sloane said.
       The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been
  relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism
  surrounding the British economy, analysts said.
      ""Money seems to be chasing yields,"" William Byers, of Bear
  Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate.
      Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the
  pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to
  relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down
  interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17.
      The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how
  well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates
  and oil income remain the main influences on the currency.
      However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K.
  interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut
  their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane
  said.
      The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but
  Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon.
      The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with
  smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a ""bull flag"" on
  price charts, technically-oriented analysts said.
      ""It makes for an explosive type of situation that often
  leads to a breakout,"" in this case to the upside, Sloane said.
      Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian
  dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent
  close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar.
      ""At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term
  positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a
  close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,"" Byers said.
      As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability
  was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.
      Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and
  June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400,
  respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430.
      Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very
  respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank
  intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada.
      ""We may still probe to see what the parameters are,"" Byers
  said, ""but people are very reluctant because they don't know
  where the central banks will be (to intervene).""
      Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price
  consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly
  sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at
  that level.

  Jamaica agreed in principle with its
  bank advisory committee on a rescheduling of 181 mln dlrs of
  foreign commercial bank debt falling due between 1987 and 1989,
  the Jamaican Information Service said.
      Repayments on the debt will be stretched out over 12 years
  with 8-1/2 years' grace at 1-1/4 percentage points over the
  London Interbank Offered Rate, Libor. The margin on previously
  restructured debt also will be cut to 1-1/4 point from 2-1/2.
      The package should save Jamaica about 3.3 mln dlrs a year.
      Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who led the Jamaican
  delegation, called the terms very favourable to his country.
      The agreement in principle with the bank advisory committee
  led by the Bank of Nova Scotia &lt;BNO.TO> comes five days after
  Jamaica successfully concluded a 125.5 mln dlr rescheduling
  accord with the Paris Club of creditor nations.
      That pact in turn followed the International Monetary Fund
  (IMF)'s approval on March 5 of a 85 mln special drawing rights
  standby arrangement and a 40.9 mln sdr drawing under the
  compensatory financing facility.
      Of Jamaica's foreign debt of 3.3 billion dlrs only 12 pct
  is owed to commercial banks, and Seaga yesterday reaffirmed the
  government's policy of not seeking new bank loans.

354,"TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS
  Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff
  cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,
  A senior economic planner said.
      Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic
  planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further
  reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
  half of this year.
      Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
  Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
      ""We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
  faster and more substantially,"" he said.
      The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said
  the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
  almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as
  too selective.
       Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
  billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign
  exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made
  Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.
      Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened
  Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,
  particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are
  among the island's main export-earners.
      A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington
  tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year
  limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.
      Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was
  limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is
  losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given
  more generous terms.

3542,"BRAZIL'S GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE
  Brazil's central bank governor
  Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today
  in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's
  unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs
  of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.
      Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of
  Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan
  Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.
      High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's
  accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade
  and interbank lines, the bankers said.
      Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed
  last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as
  part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.
      Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled
  with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal
  questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.
      They said they face problems because of the freeze
  requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank
  under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the
  central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch
  their credit lines from one borrower to another.
      The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also
  meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower
  interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather
  accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the
  central bank.
      ""It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,""
  one banker said.
      Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of
  a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister
  Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for
  Brazil's debt stance.

  Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the

      Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude

  and an Argentine firm.
      President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that

      Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of

  expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher

      He did not make any specific projections for the company's
  earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
  not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed
  four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.
      It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,
  equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share
  split.
      Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to
  property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax
  profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
      The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
  dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
  China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,
  compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it
  expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the
  remaining shares.
      Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while
  its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely
  export-led growth.
      Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year
  against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.
      But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.

      He said all of the company's major operations showed
  improved results in 1986.
      Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct

  &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from
  Hongkong Electric.
      Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong
  Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related

      Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares
  from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.
      The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
  give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.
      Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve
  Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
  making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from

  The oil services industry is on the
  verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil
  industry analysts said.
      The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some
  stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the
  second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the
  first half, and continue into the next decade.
       ""People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go
  up to start buying,"" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research
  analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.
      Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>,
  Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker
  International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>,
  which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a
  Dallas-based investor.
      Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing
  exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in
  oil services will begin in the U.S.
      ""Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up
  faster,"" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.
      The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766
  last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co
  &lt;HT> figures show.
      The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is
  projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,
  vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. ""The
  first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the
  second half of 1988,"" Kerridge said.
      Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar
  pattern, Kerridge said.
      ""Halliburton is the best value,"" said Jeffrey Freedman,
  vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding
  the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common
  stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,
  and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash
  flow including debt.
      Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service
  stock.
      ""Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant
  technical leader in the industry,"" Freedman said.
      ""Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,
  including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its
  considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to
  maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on
  the project upturn in exploration and development activity,""
  according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at
  Robert W. Baird and Co Inc.
      Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25
  cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts
  in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87
  billion dlrs.
      Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil
  service companies and said choosing among them is difficult.
  Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a
  possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.
      Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but
  possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a
  pure service company, Sweeney said.
      Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost
  reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and
  leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.

  Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> is

  pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido

      The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous
  year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share
  capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986
  from 2.7 billion a year earlier.
      Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when
  the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit
  of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.
      Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.
      The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose
  to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.
      General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment
  would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last
  year's better profits had resulted from improvements in
  services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling
  lending.
      Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate
  margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when
  compared with those in other countries, he said.
      Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and
  abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,
  Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.
      Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had
  fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,
  removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet
  total.
      In an attempt to generate more foreign business,
  representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong
  Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to
  abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and
  drawing dividends.
      Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose
  eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers
  said improved results had been widely expected by investors.
      Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in
  1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of
  2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's

  large Austrian companies.
      But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr

  OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to
  fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an
  overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to
  defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.
      He told a news conference here ""After due consultation with
  my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria
  and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold
  the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various
  quotas and official selling prices.""
      Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.
      ""We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading
  news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member
  countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the
  month of February,"" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.
      Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at
  900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm
  determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs
  agreed upon last December in Geneva.
      The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for
  OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed
  prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.
      Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but
  fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more
  than the agreed level.
      ""The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not
  hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of
  OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,"" Lukman
  said.
      He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based
  on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding
  that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000
  bpd.
      Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,
  while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab
  Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.
      ""If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement
  succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level
  of 18 dlrs,"" the group's president said.
      He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting
  formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.
      ""Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is
  at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in
  December are being adhered to,"" he said.
      Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow
  the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in
  relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied ""We consider
  the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.""
      Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn
  on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well
  below this time last year and soon they would return to the
  market in search of crude.
      ""We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in
  maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,""
  Lukman said.
      The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he
  said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise
  prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held
  view not to do anything to help the market.
      ""We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with
  two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is
  ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,"" he said.
      Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output
  following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the
  South American country would be allowed a higher output quota
  when it recovered from the disaster.

      The agreement, approved by the U.S. Department of Justice

  months instead of three to sell certain assets.
      The pact also allows a three-month extension, if warranted,

  support to the businesses to be divested, pending their sale.
      The company said its board recommended that shareholders
  approve the merger of the oilfield service companies. A
  previously adjourned meeting of Hughes Tool stockholders will
  be resumed this afternoon, it said.
      ""Hughes will work with Baker and the Justice Department
  towards negotiating the final form of the consent decree and
  filing it as soon as possible,"" the company said in a
  statement. Closing of the merger would occur immediately after
  the filing, it said.

  Ecuador's deputy energy minister
  Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on
  further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry
  following last week's earthquake, officials said.
      Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an
  expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of
  pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of
  Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.
      Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend
  Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after
  180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.
      The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that
  Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota,
  set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.
      ""All options are open at this moment in the context of
  cooperation on oil production,"" a Venezuelan energy and mines
  ministry source said.
      Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to
  compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the
  pipeline is repaired, officials said.
      Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines
  minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at
  technical level, officials said.
      Industry sources said that among the options are for
  Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela
  and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply
  Ecuador's Far Eastern clients.
      But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been
  reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made
  in due course.
      Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have
  to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its
  needs until the line was repaired.
      Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran

  American Express Co, rumored to be
  considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
  said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
  that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
  broadening international competition.
      In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
  the actions under consideration are an integral part of
  American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
  that the two companies have been having both internal and
  external discussions on the matters.
      American Express said no decision has been reached on the
  strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
  decide to follow growth plans already in place.
      Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
  financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
  Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
  selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
  speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
  the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
      There was some speculation that American Express had also
  considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
  considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
       American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
  will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
  would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
  silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
  Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
  to a Friday close at 74.
       It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
  similar statement was being circulated to employees.
      Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
  American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
  brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
  pct in the last year.
      Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
  off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
  price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
       Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
  1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
      American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
  may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
  of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
  Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
      To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
  ""(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
  capital if they need to,"" said Larry Eckenfelder of
  Prudential-Bache Securities.
      Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
  Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
  Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
       The reorganization also created four new positions for
  chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
  speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
       Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
  little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
  confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
  unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
  acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
  growth and positioning in the global market competition.
      Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
  Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
  there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
  it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

  1985, on sales increased from 4.1 billion to 4.2 billion,
  giving net earnings of 521 mln crowns against 604 mln in 1985.
      Earnings per 20-crown share went from 23.79 crowns to 20.45

      ""Foreign exchange fluctuations in 1986 were a very

  Ferrosan, which heads a group specialising in research and
  development of CNS (central nervous treatment) treatments and
  the sale of pharmaceuticals and vitamins in Scandinavia.

3645,"CHRYSLER &lt;C> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS
  Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid to
  takeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should help bolster the
  small automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000
  employees in doubt, industry analysts say.
      It was ""business as usual"" yesterday at the American Motors
  headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by
  Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to company
  spokesman Edd Snyder.
      But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,
  would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if
  it had continued with the state-run French car group as its
  controlling shareholder.
      Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly
  plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would
  be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American
  auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.
      Both plants are far from ""state of the art"" for car
  manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor
  relations at each.
      ""Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants,"" said Michael
  Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson
  Lehman Brothers. ""They probably will close the Toledo plant and
  move Jeep production to Canada.""
      Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the
  very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to
  wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union
  local representing Jeep workers.
      ""The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they
  have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have
  underutilized facilities to transfer production,"" he said.
      Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that
  would abort a combination which historians said would be the
  auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed
  in 1954.
      AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses
  of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France
  for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could
  not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the
  earliest.
      In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee
  Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln
  dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of
  1,200 dealers as the major attractions.
      Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually
  to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead
  costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur
  in the AMC buyout.

  and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
      Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
  some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
  takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
  another courier company.
      Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
  Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
      Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
  paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
  in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
  will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
  subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
  courier operations.
      If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
  would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
  debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
  Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
      Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
  dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
  Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
  the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
  the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
      Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
  While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
  30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
      This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
  recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
  170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
      Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
  caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
  firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
      Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
  U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
  several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
      E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
  complete the transaction. This so-called ""bridge"" financing
  will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
  form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
  keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
      ""Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
  largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
  management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
  serious competitor in the future,"" said Idsal.
      William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
  division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
      The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
  thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
  the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
      The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
  the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
  20 business days after commencement unless extended.

3762,"NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES
  U.K. Interest rates look set to move
  lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to
  10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of
  a British National Savings issue yesterday.
      The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury
  Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched
  in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year
  private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said
  the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national
  savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the
  market.
      The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes
  today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the
  second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.
      They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts
  issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct
  downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates
  had to drop sooner rather than later.
      The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due
  1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward
  pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the
  bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at
  10-9-7/8 pct.
       It coincided with another strong sterling rally which
  pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.
      ""That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,"" said
  Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers
  Phillips and Drew; ""It is an indication that the market believes
  rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point
  immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people
  hope for more.""
      Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the
  National Savings Department was ""of considerable significance.""
      It said, ""the real message ... Is that the decks are being
  quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the
  building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut
  in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises.""
      Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates
  would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a
  reduction in mortgage lending rates.
      Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the
  National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury
  policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.
      ""National Savings has been competing too effectively with
  the building societies of late. Building society income has
  been depressed in recent months,"" he said.
      He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer
  Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid
  on U.K. Inflation.
      Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain
  than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising
  well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after
  last year's 3.7 pct.
      Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer
  prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates
  would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.
      But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been
  complaining to the government about intense competition from
  National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early
  mortgage rate cuts.
      ""The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR
  funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the
  building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the
  National Savings move reflects this,"" one senior dealer said.
      A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this
  interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a
  reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had
  pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with
  the rest of the market.
      ""We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just
  becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money,"" he
  told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at
  least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above
  or below market rates.
      He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as
  U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and
  income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion
  stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.
      In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's
  contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,
  compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the
  previous year, official figures show.
      Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a
  further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the
  total for 11 months above target, government officials said.

  Belgian Budget Minister Guy
  Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several

  said.
      They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs
  in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's
  projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget
  deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.
      But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the

  Tenneco Inc, a company that has long
  been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today
  when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be
  targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts
  said.
      Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said ""we have no comment to
  make whatsoever."" Pickens was not available for comment.
      Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today
  after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.
      Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.
      Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,
  Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at
  market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover
  attempt.
      ""It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his
  group may be interested,"" Feretti said.
      ""But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its
  sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a
  challenge.""
      Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over
  Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> last winter, has made
  no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas
  reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner
  than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated
  in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.
      Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at
  58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of
  about 10 dlrs a share ""which is probably very attractive to
  Pickens."" Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value
  well into the 60 dlr a share range.
      ""I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile
  takeover,"" Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst
  John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.
      ""Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs
  in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding."" He said the
  buyer would also have to deal with ""the intractable problems""
  Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy
  businesses.
      Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of
  defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as
  spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to
  shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership
  out of its natural gas pipeline interests.
      An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged
  the Pickens rumor. ""Pickens has a plateful already with his
  holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess,"" he said. ""I
  don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems
  with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing
  about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion
  dlrs on the market today.""

  to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> for one billion

  here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products
  valued at 1.8 billion dlrs.
      About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the
  type South Korea normally bought from Japan.
      Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks
  with Canadian officials and businessmen.
      He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce
  his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States
  and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan.
      Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates
  between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy
  U.S. goods than Japanese goods.
      He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he
  hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to
  resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation.
      Rha said ""I hope the leaders can get together to find a
  solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions.""
      But he added ""the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions
  because of domestic political reasons.""
      Speaking of his own country, he said ""We have made a lot of
  concessions already.""
      He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in
  industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity
  and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by
  strengthening protection of copyrights and patents.
      Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs.
      Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if
  Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said ""at this
  moment, we have no thought of retaliation.""
      South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of
  textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television
  sets, video cassette records and personal computers.
      Its puchases from the United States include electronic
  testing equipment and grains and cotton.
      The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing
  passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas
  planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs.

  An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool
  Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker
  International Corp based on revised terms that allow the
  companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as
  required by the U.S. Justice Department.
       Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of
  the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how
  much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on
  the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.
      An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a
  funding limit.
      The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2
  billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through
  earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed
  Justice Department consent decree that would have given the
  companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed
  business.
      Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr
  lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the
  merger.
      Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of
  Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised
  terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a
  buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous
  agreement had proposed a three-month period.
      Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would
  consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month
  extension to complete the sale.
      He said there were ""several people looking"" at the domestic
  drilling bit business.
      The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to
  voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.
      Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be
  completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost
  savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects ""substantial
  cutbacks"" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,
  the name the merged company will take.
      Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies
  should put the company on a profitable course. ""We think that
  in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see
  something close to breakeven,"" he said.
      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs

  House trade lawmakers took their
  first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but
  held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on
  controversial plans to protect American industries.
      Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade
  Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues
  in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading
  partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United
  States.
      The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of
  Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open
  foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force
  President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.
      Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the
  lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will
  consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting
  specific trade penalties.
      The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and
  Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.
      Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking
  his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an
  amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of
  those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.
      This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to
  force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus
  with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West
  Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.
      ""My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for
  getting the trade deficit down,"" he told reporters.
      The trade law changes are to become part of a major
  congressional and administration effort to turn around the
  record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by
  opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more
  competitive.
      House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again
  today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by
  May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.
      ""I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means
  Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective
  bill,"" he told reporters.
      The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other
  committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid
  U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate
  research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and
  to improve education and worker training.
      The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.
  industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition
  if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,
  safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the
  country's economic development.
      They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to
  retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and
  whether an injured industry deserves import relief.
      They agreed to make it easier for a company to get
  temporary relief from import competition but agreed the
  industry should provide a plan to become competitive.
      The administration has not announced its support but
  Yeutter said yesterday, ""I am cautiously optimistic,"" that the
  Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.

4027,"SOVIET MINISTER SAYS TRADE BOOST UP TO FRENCH
  Soviet first deputy prime minister
  Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his
  country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a
  reduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union
  depended on the French.
      Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State
  Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference
  he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French
  companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.
      Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he
  had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly
  sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for
  agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable
  juice processing with Imec.
      An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on
  packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other
  details. The other two companies were not immediately available
  for comment.
      Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's
  trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months
  of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky
  told Reuters: ""It all depends on France.""
      At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet
  foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased
  efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a
  French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.
      Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with
  anybody with ""interesting"" proposals offering latest technology
  and assuring ""a mutual advantage.""
      He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and
  would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.
      He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws
  guaranteeing ""the interests of foreign partners"" in joint
  ventures.
      But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the
  new joint venture laws.
      He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a
  result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last
  month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.
      He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals
  for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month
  said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of
  goods.
      Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and
  designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's
  food production capacity.

  have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and

  with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
  those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
  of companies they invest in.
      ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
  for that is but a short step from saying that they should be

  the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said.
      He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
  play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more

  (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
  not the takeover was contested,"" he said.

  under duress.

  cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their
  total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month.
      At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados

4067,"SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD
  Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are
  reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing
  provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non-
  performing loans.
      Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build
  reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a
  little this year.
      But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems
  hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will
  remain vulnerable.
      One senior bank credit officer said ""The work is largely
  done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,
  but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.""
      The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in
  1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has
  taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now
  appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad
  decline.
      The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had
  sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world
  oil prices tumbled.
      Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on
  the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and
  revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at
  the expense of increased provisions.
      The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, &lt;United Saudi
  Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln
  riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln.
      Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part
  reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly
  trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to
  60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.
      Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank>
  (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7
  mln riyals, while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi
  French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.
      Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N>
  Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,
  increased provisions sharply.
      &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1
  mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln
  riyals.
      Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-
  performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the
  Saudi economy bottoms out.
      Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic
  activity, but one banker said ""The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks
  are now at or close to international levels on provisions.""
      From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank &lt;National
  Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in
  provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the
  private sector, bankers calculated.
      Between 1982 and 1985, &lt;Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the
  second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had
  covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate
  on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.
      Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been
  tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for
  declaring loans as non-performing.
      Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures
  difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest
  as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in
  force in major world financial centres.
      Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the
  joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank
  as the strongest earners.
      Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by
  the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a
  relatively low deposit base.
      Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln
  riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another
  low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most
  conservative in making provisions.
      Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a
  Saudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank>
  after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made
  available cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB.
      The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but
  generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are
  unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.
      And while banks in more liberal financial markets can
  attempt to diversify away from traditional lending,
  conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate
  fee income from new investment banking products.
      One banker said ""Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not
  good.""
      Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of
  advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when
  banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to
  invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return
  on their money.
      In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current
  accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer
  funds are held on current account.

  the Nomura research institute said.
      Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in

  Securities Co said in a statement.
      Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the

      Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation, such
  as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next

  announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeks
  ending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in the
  previous year.
      Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. A
  final dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p last
  year. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p.
      The results were broadly in line with market expectations,
  leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence from
  yesterday's close, but slightly off pre-announcement opening
  levels.
      Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg,
  up from the previous year's 60.7 mln.
      The U.K. Remained Rowntree's largest centre for trading
  profits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985.
  Profit from its second largest geographical area, North
  America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American
  profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar.
      Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in
  trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in
  Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of
  the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.
      Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a
  16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this
  represented additional provisions for the cost of
  rationalisation plans announced in earlier years.
      Rowntree expects North American operations will this year,
  ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those
  from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement
  said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.
      Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide,
  including further moves in the speciality retailing business
  which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.
      Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by
  chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance
  of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.
      The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and
  increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern
  increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business,
  Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.
      Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost
  the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits
  on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong
  competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.

  The Bank of England does not favour the
  introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
  attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
      Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
  show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
  have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
  Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
  dinner.
      Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
  with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
  those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
  of companies they invest in.
      ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
  for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
  protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
  the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said.
      He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
  play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
  efficient market penetration. ""The degree of success or failure
  (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
  not the takeover was contested,"" he said.
      Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
  activity in the recent past. ""The aim is to pressurise a
  company's management into action dedicated solely to a
  favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
  or even primarily at the expense of the future,"" he said.
      Such bids ""often depend for their success on creating a
  highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
  and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
  engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
  immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,"" he
  said.
      In a clear reference recent events, he said ""those in the
  City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,

  it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.""

  Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil

  deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
      Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
  an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
      The additional output would be related to plans now under

  it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
      Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo

4132,"JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR
  Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> hopes for
  another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986
  net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in
  the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.
      The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss
  francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend
  per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.
      Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the
  company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made
  possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986
  which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.
      Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic
  affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24
  billion francs was due to currency factors.
      A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset
  by growth in operations and by structural changes within the
  group.
      Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs
  from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate
  sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The
  tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and
  lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.
      Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany
  to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of
  acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25
  pct against 25.3 pct.
      Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct
  from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite
  write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further
  increase in tax levels was expected in future.
      Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln
  the previous year.

  liquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality of
  its properties.

      Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debt
  service payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houston
  properties is due to mature on April One.
      Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate and
  extend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.
      It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houston
  properties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, if
  granted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  The
  loan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or other
  litigation connected with the specific properties involved and
  could involve the suspension of interest and principal payments
  to some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts to
  restructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more of
  the properties.
      Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pct
  of its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs per
  share, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.
      The company said depending on the success of the talks and

  become subject to similar negotiations.  The two additional
  properties comprised about 11 pct of its current value equity

  longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be
  settled.
      Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings
  with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would
  be held in June and September to discuss the role of the
  provinces in approving any new trade deal.
      But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping
  talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years
  ago.
      ""It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the
  talks),"" Mulroney said.
      Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, ""Things are running pretty
  quickly now.""
      The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative
  government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the
  world's largest trading partnership.
      But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any

  complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification
  formula.
      ""It's my view that we should be thinking about these things
  right now, along with the questions of the substance of the
  agreement,"" commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has
  been highly critical of the talks in the past.
      But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement
  was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no
  need for a ""hard and fast formula.""

  concessions to the United States on financial services in order
  to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture.
      Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say
  the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it
  will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff
  barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.

  the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is

  Sand Technology Systems Inc said it is

  expects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a loss
  last year.
      The stock consolidation ""is something we're discussing, but
  it's not definite,"" Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner
  told Reuters in an interview.
      A private placement recently brought the number of
  outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July
  31, 1986, the fiscal yearend.
      ""The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,""
  Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply
  for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange.
      Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of
  five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs,
  for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third
  quarter should be about the same as the second, he added.
      Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195
  dlrs in the second quarter.
      After ""a disastrous first quarter,"" Sand hopes to break even
  in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has
  scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the
  33.5 mln dlrs projected in December.
      The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and
  Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,
  or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs.
      In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost
  1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585
  dlrs.
      Shattner believes the company will post better results this
  year due to several factors.
      ""Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying
  products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi
  in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the
  second quarter,"" he said.
      Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer
  accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement
  devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT> of
  Japan.
      Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc,
  is developing software that lets large maniframe computers
  handle large databases and share them between applications.
      It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which
  is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major
  corporations.
      The company has also reduced costs through some staff
  cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff
  instead of straight commissions, Shattner said.

4170,"BANKERS OPPOSE STRICT TAIWAN CURRENCY CONTROLS
  Taiwan imposed currency controls today
  in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation
  as the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency.
      The strict controls will require proof that large
  remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions
  rather than currency speculation.
      Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they
  were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster
  appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar,
  which would slow exports to the United States.
      Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports,
  shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government
  approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from
  any other source.

4172,"TAIWAN TO RELAX IMPORT CURBS ON MORE GOODS
  Taiwan will relax import controls on
  more foreign goods, a government spokesman said today.
      The move was to allow greater access to Taiwan markets by
  overseas trading partners, especially the United States, an
  official of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
  told Reuters.
      Import curbs on about 400 foreign goods, including
  stationery and books, would soon be relaxed, he said.
      Taiwan announced it would ease curbs on some 600 farming
  and industrial products last month.
      The official said the moves were intended to balance trade
  between Taiwan and the United States and other trading
  partners. Taiwan's trade surplus reached a record 15.6 billion
  dlrs last year, up from 10.62 billion in 1985.

4174,"MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS
  Most Japanese companies have decided not
  to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
  prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,
  industry sources said.
      They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
  traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
  official price of 17.42 dlrs.
      Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
  Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
      The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
  total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude
  under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
  the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
      They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
  on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
  depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
      ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
  probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japanese
  refiner said.
      ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added.
      Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
  at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
  considerably lower, oil traders said.
      They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
  problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
  Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
  finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
  likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.
      The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
  OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the
  fixed prices.
      But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
  its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
  would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
      They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
  based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
  should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
  a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.
      One Japanese refiner said, ""At the moment there's a lot of
  pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
  there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their
  ability.""
      Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
  told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, ""Nigeria and all
  member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
  December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
  and official selling prices.""
      He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
  of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
  well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
  return to the market in search of crude.
      A Japanese refiner said, ""The European and U.S. Markets are
  beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.""

  K Mart Corp said its record fiscal
  1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs
  a year ago, marked a ""major turning point"" for the world's
  second biggest retailer.
      K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended
  January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from 
  ""merchandising, refurbishing and expense control.""
      A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for
  discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail
  operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a
  share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.
      K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said ""the success of these
  programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase
  in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes
  to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached
  this milestone.""
      Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8
  billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior
  year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued
  operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over
  1985, it said.
      Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer
  acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, ""a marked increase
  in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from
  specialty retailing operations.""
      K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from
  continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from
  372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8
  pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in
  1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.
      K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct
  from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and
  administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct
  in 1985.
      ""Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K
  Mart,"" Fauber said in a statement.
      ""In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on
  changing the look of our stores and the structure of the
  company.""
      K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store
  remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,
  upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty
  retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured
  its long-term debt.
      ""We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of
  slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment
  community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,
  our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct

  Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to
  its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of
  the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a
  barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources
  said.
      They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March
  averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the
  neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average
  of 3.5 mln bpd.
      They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
  oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be
  counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's
  quota is 4.133 mln bpd.
      The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the
  world""s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec
  official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the
  sources said.
      King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with
  Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi
  commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an
  average 18 dlrs.
      ""Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,"" he
  said.
      The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports
  averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,
  down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.
      They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
  with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
  artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.
      The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with
  past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,
  Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the
  timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
  official prices, the sources said.
      Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
  still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
  liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.
      They expected low early March output to pick up towards the
  end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual
  obligations.

  Sweden announced its promised program

  firms an October deadline to cut trading links.
      Foreign Trade Minister Anita Gradin said a trade boycott of
  South Africa and neighbouring Namibia would take effect from
  July 1, followed by a three-month period of grace to give
  companies time to wind down their operations.
      From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either
  direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies
  and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference.
      She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a
  Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and
  disadvantage South Africa's black-ruled neighbours, the
  front-line states.
      Gradin cautioned that legislation upon which the boycott
  would be based was not impossible to get round. She said a
  parliamentary committee would investigate ways of closing some
  of the bigger loopholes, including indirect trade with South
  Africa via Swedish subsidiaries in third countries.

  British Telecommunications Plc's &lt;BTY.L>
  profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by
  increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old
  telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.
      Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results
  which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company
  faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems
  in Britain for three to five years.
      He said &lt;Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless
  Plc &lt;CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.
      Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some
  of British Telecom's most profitable areas.
      One company official privately estimated that British
  Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications
  market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.
      The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which
  lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged
  clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.
      However, he forecast that the last quarter's results
  overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.
      He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at
  50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should
  be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.
      But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,
  economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth
  industry will help produce annual profit increases for the
  forseeable future.
      British Telecom will also seek to expand into
  manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development
  expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with
  the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.
      Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped
  shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's
  close and off an early high of 248p.
      Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said
  the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven
  to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit
  over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax
  profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.
      Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking
  charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising
  prices was limited as long as inflation remains low.

      It said shareholders of record as of April 10 will be
  eligible to vote at the meeting.
      Instinet said the meeting date is subject to adjustment,
  based on the length of time needed for the U.S. Securities and
  Exchange Commission to complete its review of the filing of
  merger proxy materials, which Instinet expects to make before
  the end of March.
      Instinet said the filing of the preliminary merger proxy
  materials is tied to the finalization of audited financial
  statements of Instinet and Reuters for 1986.
      Under a merger agreement entered into in November, Reuters
  tendered for up to 5.10 mln Instinet common shares, or about 45
  pct of those not already owned by Reuters. As a result of the
  tender, Reuters now owns about 49 pct of Instinet shares.
      In the merger, holders of remaining Instinet shares will
  receive 8.50 dlrs of Reuters American Depositary Shares for
  each Instinet share.
      The ADS's will be valued at the average of their closing

  Cyacq Corp, an investor group
  bidding for Cyclops Corp, said it would raise its outstanding
  tender offer price for Cyclops common to 92.50 dlrs a share
  from 80 dlrs, if certain conditions were met.
      The increased offer would exceed the 90.25 dlrs a share
  price offered by Dixons Group PLC in a tender offer for Cyclops
  that is part of a definitive agreement to acquire the
  Pittsburgh-based maker of carbon tool and specialty steel
  products.
      Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp
  Capital Investors Ltd and other investors.
      Cyclops has about 4.1 mln shares outstanding.
      For the tender price to be raised, Cyclops must provide
  Cyacq with all non-public information provided to Dixons Group
  and Cyacq must be satisfied with financial projections made in
  offering material by Dixons based on the information, Cyacq
  said.
      Additionally, Dixon Group's rights to buy Cyclops common
  and its rights to fees or expenses if the Dixon-Cyclop merger
  agreement is broken must be rescinded, Cyacq said.
      Cyacq said financial projections it developed for Cyclops
  were materially lower than the financial projections provided
  by Cyclops to Dixons Group.
      A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no details of
  the new Cyacq proposal and could not comment. ""We have nothing
  in hand,"" she said.
      In addition to making specialty metal products, Cyclops
  also operates about 115 specialty stores that sell consumer
  electronics products. The stores are located in 17 states
  concentrated in the Northeast, Northwest and Southwest.
      Cyclops employs about 8,900 people in Pennsylvania, Ohio
  and other states. It also has interests in non-residential
  construction.
      In 1986, Cyclops earned 21.3 mln dlrs or 5.26 dlrs a share
  on sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, compared to 1985 earnings of 26.2
  mln dlrs or 6.20 dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion, the spokeswoman

      The agreement with Dixons Group calls for Cyclops's steel
  and construction businesses to be sold to a unit of Alleghany

      A Cyacq spokesman said the new conditional tender price

4340,"WILDLIFE UNIT PROPOSES ALASKA REFUGE OIL STUDY
  The National Wildlife Federation 
  rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness
  lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.
      The federation, the nation's largest conservation group,
  said further study was needed to assess any possible damage
  that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the
  coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
      Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called
  the Interior's research into the effects of development ""so
  fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on
  which to make a public policy decision.""
      Hair called the department's proposal a ""reflection of a
  largely political decision,"" adding ""we have no confidence in
  Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.""
      Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain
  to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough 
  safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.
      It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold
  billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as
  an energy resource would never be known without exploration.
      Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10
  billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.
      Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas
  exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a
  wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.
      Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the
  probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.
      He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,
  fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered
  nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection
  Agency on the possible effects of exploration.
      The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a
  nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the
  issue and report back to Congress in about two years.
      Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible
  exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to
  make a sound judgement.
      Congressional observers said that at present there was
  little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for
  commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the
  United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.

  A Purolator Courier Corp director

      The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter
  to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by
  the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
      Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in
  which the company would bought out by a group of its managers
  and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc bar directors from taking action to
  solicit, initiate or encourage acquisition proposals.
      ""I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or

  therefore, that I should resign as a director of the
  corporation,"" Gardner said in the letter.
      ""Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator
  Courier Corp, effective immediately,"" he said.
      Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better
  deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be
  sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part
  of its U.S. courier division.
      On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields,
  filed a class action suit on behalf of the company's
  shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching
  their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that
  shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout.
      The deal would give shareholders 35 dlrs a share in cash if
  just 83 pct of Purolator's 7.6 mln shares are tendered. If more

  Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to

  28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said.
      Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at
  140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.
      Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently
  shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some
  months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have
  been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.
       Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the 
  shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets
  bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.
      Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is
  due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the
  jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity
  220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following
  its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman
  said.
      The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will
  not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.
      In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de
  BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since
  March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is
  181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct
  capacity, a company spokesman said.
      Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in
  early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity
  is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR)
  will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early
  April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a
  company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.
      Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however,
  traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more
  attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished
  in two to three weeks.
      As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the
  situation may ease by mid-April.

  Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on
  specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would
  find a new suitor for the company, traders said.
      Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265
  mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of
  its Purolator courier division's management.
      The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.
      Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities
  and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned
  from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.
      The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because
  the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from
  soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a
  better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be
  found if the company would agree to be sold to some other
  entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier
  division.
      ""Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has
  450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's
  being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,"" said Gardner in a telephone
  interview with Reuters.
      Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm
  associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity
  companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he
  personally owns 20,000 shares.
      A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
  letter from Gardner.
      Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
  may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the
  transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also
  speculated another courier company would be the most likely
  suitor.
      While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
  new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed
  the stock into play again.
      ""There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question
  of management's willingness to let the process continue,"" said
  one arbitrager.
      Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
  believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.
  Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
  cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought
  for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.
  courier operations.
      The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
  Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
  will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in
  Purolator.
      ""As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
  deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.
  One always likes a situation like that. You always like to
  think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be
  someone else in the world that could do it higher,"" said one
  arbitrager.
      The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and
  sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
  firm will not end up paying for its equity position.
      While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
  did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
  keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some
  risk to the firm.
      ""There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,
  and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,"" said
  one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to
  employees.
      The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
  in so-called ""bridge"" financing for the transaction. The bridge
  financing is a temporary loan from Hutton.
      The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,
  expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to
  replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could
  be a substantial expense to the firm.
      Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
  dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction
  said fees are at the low end of the scale.
      ""It's a very complex transaction, but basically what
  happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
  any investment they might have once the merger takes place,""
  Gardner said.

  leaving the United States,"" one of the Pentagon officials, who
  asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
      Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that
  Baldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House
  Economic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.
      Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinberger
  feared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily on
  foreign electronic support.
      But the Defense Department also said today that Weinberger
  and Baldrige differed on the proposed sale of U.S. computer
  equipment to Iran.
      The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently that
  defense objections to two proposed sales -- to an Iranian power
  company and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency -- were
  not valid and the sales of small and medium computers would go
  through unless more evidence was presented.

  ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
  higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
  Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
      Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
  over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
  mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
      ""This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
  maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
  bidder,"" an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
  announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
      ""This is totally by surprise,"" said Debra Strohmaier, a
  ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
  scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
  announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
  certain when it would be ready. 
      She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
  between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
      ""I think they will resist it,"" said Elliott Schlang,
  analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. ""Any company that
  doesn't like a surprise attack would.""
      Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
  offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
  could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
  acquired by Waste Management.
      Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
  ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
  examples of companies that could be interested.
      ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
  company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
  herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
  wastes.
      Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
  another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
  residential and commercial distribution system.
      Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
  catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
  the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
      Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
  fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
  the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
      Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
  individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

  Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
  currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
  distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons
  chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.
      Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham
  last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'
  &lt;Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact
  after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
  &lt;Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>.
      ""We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope
  there won't be any change, but there could be,"" Holden-Brown
  told reporters after a speech in Toronto.
      He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could
  force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and
  Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate
  Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.
      ""Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
  for either the put or call to be exercised,"" Holden-Brown said.
      In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said it
  would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
  pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. ""I don't
  think we would have any objection to it,"" he added.
      Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's
  board of directors and has total responsibility for its
  management. ""We cannot contemplate giving up our control,"" he
  said.
      Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit
  contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial
  results, but he said ""it will be substantial.""
      ""I am not able to give profit forecasts,"" he said.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the
  Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,
  and has no current plans for a stock issue.
      He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
  acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
  possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food
  concerns. ""I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery

  The use of generic in-kind commodity
  certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a

      Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on
  wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president
  of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies
  have made huge profits from certificate trading.
      ""The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the
  trade,"" he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing
  with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that
  this is within the normal grain marketing levels.
      Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of
  certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to
  look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for
  example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll
  marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.
      Certificates are also an important part of any export
  promotion program, he said.
      ""The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the
  more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain
  into the market to meet demand,"" he said.

  The House Ways and Means Trade 
  Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of

  foreign markets to more U.S. goods.
      The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
  Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,
  congressional sources said.
      ""This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
  and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
  frightening word 'protectionism',"" Ways and Means chairman Dan
  Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
      The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
  retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
  practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.
      But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
  debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to
  mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by
  countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
      Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact
  form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House
  approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut
  by those countries. 
      The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from
  other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls,
  incentives for research, expanded worker training and education
  and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness.
      The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the
  full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate
  committees.
      It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign
  unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and
  allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by
  U.S. actions against other countries.
      The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win
  relief from surges of imports of competitive products.
      It extends until January 1993, the administration's
  authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new
  round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on
  Tariffs and Trade.

  Brazil's state-oil company,
  Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi
  Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees
  from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.
      Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the
  Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such
  conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of
  its commercial debts last month.
      The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil
  consumption in Brazil.
      But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and
  decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras
  will lift the order to cancel the shipment.
      Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by
  Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.
      ""Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since
  1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much
  better for us, because with the market prices more or less the
  same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,"" he said.
      Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing
  Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing
  from Brazil, he said.
      Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry
  workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras
  oil stocks are ""reasonably balanced."" 
      Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with
  an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000
  bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
      ""If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I
  am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers

      Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated
  microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips
  and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.
      Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed
  takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying ""the purchase
  would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor
  market.""
      Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost
  pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.
      The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its
  domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.
      U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese
  public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite
  U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field.
      ""The United States believes Japan will only react when
  bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,"" Salomon Brothers Asia
  analyst Carole Ryavec said.
      However, the analysts said more is at stake than
  supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital
  semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.
      ""The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,""
  said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.
      U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has
  failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms
  to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing
  and opening Japan's market.
      A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding
  by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of
  microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those
  set by the pact.
      ""It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,""
  he told Reuters.
      Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the
  acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with
  Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters.

  Brazil's state oil company
  Petrobras has cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from
  Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit
  guarantees from the Bank of Brazil and did not disclose
  reasons, a Petrobras official said.
      Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis
  were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after
  Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial
  debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents
  two days of consumption.
      He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept
  letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi
  banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees
  from leading international banks.
      In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from
  the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest
  oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main
  supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
      ""If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am
  sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from
  elsewhere,"" Santana added.
      Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to
  respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the
  order to cancel the shipment.
      The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous
  shipment, he added. ""We telexed them saying that if they
  insisted, we would rather cancel the contract and buy the

  Sandoz AG &lt;SANZ.Z> would
  have reported a percentage rise in net profits ""close to double
  figures"" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for
  November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said.
      The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters
  Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with
  the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which
  caused severe pollution of the Rhine.
      Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits
  to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct
  increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.
      This year began well, with the performance in January and
  February at least equal to the same period last year, the
  official said.
      The company is expected to give fuller details of its
  results at a news conference on April 22.
      Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover
  any liability arising from the accident.
      The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the
  ""one pct"" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary
  gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution
  from the fire.
      Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been
  flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the
  Rhine since the accident.
      However, the official said the final figure would be ""much
  less than that cited in earlier comments."" He gave no further
  details.
      In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy &lt;CIGZ.Z>,
  which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also
  hit by the falling dollar, the official said.
      Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with
  market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this
  was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange
  effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to
  8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.

  Schweizerische Aluminimum AG &lt;ALUZ.Z>
  (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing
  its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
      ""The threshold of profitability has returned to the
  foreseeable future,"" he said. ""We expect already in 1987
  approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that
  our industrial environment does not worsen.""
      He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past
  losses.
      Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986
  after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.
      Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and
  net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.
      Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for
  1985.
      But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news
  conference the new management installed a year ago had decided
  to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate
  rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an
  asset.
      Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an
  gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from
  472 mln in 1985.
      It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,
  after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary
  in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in
  1985.
      Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from
  1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and
  exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a
  50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.
      Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this ""radical
  elimination of the mortgages of the past"" painful, but said the
  foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.
      Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was
  strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56
  billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.
      Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111
  mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct
  in 1985.
      In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had
  arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of
  Switzerland &lt;SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z> and Credit
  Suisse &lt;CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a
  subordinated loan.
      The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not
  cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only
  to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a
  new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss
  banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.
      Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining
  bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.
      That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss
  instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169
  mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a
  479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.
      The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of
  1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar
  alternations were made for previous years.
      After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895
  mln francs.

  inflation
  plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the

      Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the

  indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
  pct inflation rate.
      But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.

      The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a

  foreign debt.
      For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
  target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one

  increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
  plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged

  Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream said
  it has restated its previously-reported fourth quarter loss to
  904,000 dlrs or 13 cts per share because it has now decided to
  take a charge of about 700,000 dlrs to provide for losses of
  Midwest Distributing Co, which was acquired December 30.
      Dreyer's said the restatement reduces net income for the

      The company said the restatement does not indicate any
  change in its thinking on the benefits of the acquisition or
  future prospects in Midwest Distributing's markets.
      Dreyer's Grand previously reported 1986 earnings of
  6,614,000 dlrs or 90 cts per share, down from 7,960,000 dlrs or
  1.08 dlrs a share.  For the first nine months of the year, it
  had earned 6,818,000 dlrs or 92 cts per share, up from

  Caesars World Inc said its board

      Caesars said Sosnoff's offer to by all its outstanding
  shares of common stock was inadequate and not in the best
  interests of its shareholders.
      The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoff's
  offer, made through his &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, and not tender

      Caesars said it will explore a variety of alternative
  transactions but did not elaborate.
      Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would
  seek to buy back its shares held by Sosnoff.
      A Caesars spokesman said the company would not comment
  further on its decision.
      On Wednesday, Sosnoff told the Securities and Exchange
  Commission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock.
      Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered to
  buyout his holdings several times during the past year.
      No one from the Sosnoff organization was immediately

      Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert

  inadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff.
      The company said other factors it considered in rejecting
  the offer were its financial condition, future prospects,

  Sosnoff's bid was conditioned.

4809,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY
  The European Monetary System marks its
  eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money
  markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability
  in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,
  which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow
  fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.
      Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has
  been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike
  seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.
      And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as
  Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality
  when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.
      But economists say members such as West Germany have so far
  blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's
  founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
  former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
      Under this phase, originally due to have started two years
  after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been
  transferred from national governments and central banks to an
  autonomous European Monetary Fund.
     But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in
  economic and monetary matters. ""The basic problem of the EMS is
  that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a
  situation where certain decisions are taken in common,"" said one
  economist who has closely watched the system's development.
      The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on
  third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the
  system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.
      Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and
  investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp
  rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE
      As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against
  EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as
  West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several
  EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow
  the mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease
  financial and trade strains within the community.
      Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued
  by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct
  against other currencies in the system -- the French franc,
  Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown.
     Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the
  EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world
  currency, outside the system.
      No change in the British government's attitude is expected
  before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.
      Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it
  was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's
  highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central
  Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.
      Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers
  hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.
      But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve
  more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical
  about the chances for any fundamental change.
      ""Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS
  against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we
  must take the step forward to the institutional level,"" said Leo
  de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.
      Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend
  largely on the success of an agreement last month among major
  industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar
  resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they
  predict.

  it expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.
      The company said it expects to report ""strong earnings per
  share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987."" It
  said this should be achieved despite expected non-operating
  charges in the final quarter.
      General Mills said these charges will likely offset
  non-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the
  first half.
      General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its
  return on average equity was 31.6 pct.
      It said major factors contributing to the third quarter
  improvement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer
  Foods, continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and
  strong performance in Specialty Retailing.
      The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,
  or 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a
  year ago. Sales rose to 1.31 billion dlrs from 1.13 billion
  dlrs. Year-ago data reflect a two-for-one common stock split.

  Bally Manufacturing Corp said it is

      In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks,
  Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain
  to the public. The company will register a proposed offering
  with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of
  the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters.
      ""Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,""
  Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company
  would use much of the income from the amusement park chain,
  were it to be sold, to repay debt.
      Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts
  said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at
  350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said.
      Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six
  Flags by several prospective buyers.
      The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln
  dlrs mountain of debt.
      Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the
  Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget
  Inc &lt;GNG.N>.
      The purchase pushed its long-term debt to 1.6 billion dlrs,

      Bally's 325-unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in
  1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs, or about 28 pct of Bally's
  total revenues of 1.64 billion dlrs.
      Bally acquired Six Flags for 147.4 mln dlrs in January 1982
  from Penn Central Corp. Bally bought the Great America theme
  park in Gurnee, Ill., in May 1984 for 113.2 mln dlrs from
  Marriott Corp &lt;mhs>.
      In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48.6 mln
  dlrs on revenues of 369.4 mln dlrs.
      The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating
  profit of 60.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475.6 mln dlrs in 1986,
  of which 456.2 mln came from the clubs.
      The company earlier this month said it will take a charge

  Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads
  one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
  Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
  share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
  Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
  portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
      Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
  he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
      The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
  Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
  purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
  share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
      Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
  from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
  management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
  company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
      The company did not disclose the details of the revised
  offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
  them later today.
      The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
  and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
  agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
  completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
  at least half of the outstanding stock.
      The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
  which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
  they keep the information secret.
      In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
  completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
  America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
      Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
  syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
  separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
  financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
  Redstone said.
      Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
  its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
  financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
  it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
      Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
  dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
      The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
  consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
  and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
      The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
  proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
  contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
      Last week, the management group submitted what it called
  its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
  consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
  at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
  previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

  to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could
  be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry
  officials said.
      They said it would take about two months and at least 15
  mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to
  Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian
  pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's
  Pacific Ocean coast.
      The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to
  transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of
  Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.
      The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for
  Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about
  17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean
  energy ministry official said.
      The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by
  boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic
  demand.
      The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to
  resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an 
  earthquake the night before.
      The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle
  oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific
  Ocean.
      Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the
  earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the
  pipeline to Balao, government officials said.
      Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln

  A study group said the United States

      U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750
  mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the
  economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.
      The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private

  development techniques.
      It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a

  imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.
      The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to
  protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such
  device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.
      But the group did not strongly back either option, saying
  there were benefits and drawbacks to both.

  business forum of the Commercial Development Association ""We
  are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look
  like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth
  markets we've identified.""
      Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude ""that if
  we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it
  was worth doing, we had to go it alone,"" Lichtenberger
  explained.
      He said ""there are times when exploiting a profitable
  market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to
  plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link
  up profitably with someone who is already there.""
      He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way
  and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the
  same way.

5057,"TRADE BILL TO CHANGE AGRICULTURE TRADE LAWS
  The House Ways and Means Committee
  is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
  intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
  goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
      The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
  take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
  exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
  unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
      The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
  government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
  chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
      The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
  next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
  approved.
       In investigations involving a processed agricultural
  product, trade associations of processors or producers would
  have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
  duties.
       The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
  the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
  seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
  export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
  non-tariff barriers.
       President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
  agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
  to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
  through January 3, 1991.
      The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
  international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
      It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
  imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
  of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
  re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
  before Octoer 1, 1991.
      Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
  processed within three years after import and exported within
  five years.
      Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
  complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
  imports.

5070,"AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS
  Central banks have easily beaten back
  the foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized
  nations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.
      In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,
  sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But
  operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central
  banks signalled their displeasure.
      ""So far G-6 has been a roaring success,""said James O'Neill,
  financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.
      ""The central banks are sending strong signals that they
  won't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind
  currencies,"" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.
      On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank
  governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.
  -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under
  which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of
  exchange rates around prevailing levels.
      The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an
  attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable
  two-year decline against major world currencies.
      And initially, traders indicated their respect for the
  accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.
      But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87
  marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before
  the G-6 accord.
      The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy
  picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German
  economy was regressing.
      But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave
  traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the
  idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.
      Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank
  actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply
  telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading
  conditions.
      But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around
  1.85 marks. ""The market was surprised that the Fed showed its
  face so soon,"" said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill.
      Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England
  intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.
  currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the
  G-6 pact.
      Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like
  the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after
  traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant
  to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays
  on dollar/mark and dollar/yen.
      The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving
  U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March
  17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the
  incumbent Conservative party in any general election.
      ""There was a real run on sterling,"" said Anne Mills of
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870
  dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday
  and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. ""There's been some
  heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's
  U.K. budget,"" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.
      As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and
  British central banks, they acclerated their shift into
  Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were
  stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.
      The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar
  today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.
      And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,
  sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.
      The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents
  today from a high of 69.02 Thursday.
      Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden
  upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next
  step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a
  very tight range against the dollar for several months.
      The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.
  Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long
  sterling/short mark positions established lately.
      ""Because of the change in perceptions about the health of
  the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations
  are ending up in yen,"" a dealer at one U.K. bank said.
      Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,
  lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.
      Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who
  have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian
  financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the
  end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.
      Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most
  controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with
  Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of
  the dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.
      In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through
  the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it
  intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.
  On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.
      ""Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in
  January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches
  on and the situation changes,"" said McGroarty of Discount.

  Weyerhaeuser Co said it should

  be another very good year.
      Weyerhaeuser reported 1986 earnings of 276.7 mln dlrs, or
  1.91 dlrs per share, on 5.65 billion dlrs in revenues.
      Anticipated improved cash flows will allow the company to
  invest and acquire much more aggressively than it has in the
  past few years, Weyerhaeuser also said.
      Weyerhaeuser, principally a lumber products company, said
  the forecast was made by the company's chief financial officer
  during a meeting of institutional investors in Tokyo.
      It also said its expects to see opportunities in the
  building products area, particularly in composite panels and in
  other engineered products directed toward specific, rather than
  commodity, end-use markets.
      But it said growth may be higher in added-value products,
  in financial services and in other diversified businesses.
      In addition, the company said rising product prices and
  demand for pulp and paper are reflected in all the major world
  markets, except in the case of some light-weighted paper grades
  where overcapacity remains a problem.
      Weyerhaeuser further stated that it has lowered its
  manufacturing cost structure and is obtaining significant

      Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline

  U.S. economic data due out next week is
  unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest
  rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of
  the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.
      ""People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the
  current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve
  doing anything,"" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman
  Mains.
      The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading
  volume, he noted. ""We've had a decline in activity as recent
  economic statistics have not greatly changed people's
  viewpoints on interest rates,"" Mains said.
      The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the
  economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange
  markets after the Paris initiative has made for ""less than
  ebullient market action,"" Mains said.
      He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in
  for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the
  top of the trading range.
      ""My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and
  market participants will see that current prices are
  unjustified,"" Mains said.
      Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted
  that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks
  retail interest. ""All of the movement occurs at the opening,""
  afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.
      Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond
  prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward
  revisions in January retail sales and industrial production
  were ""not real exciting,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred
  Leiner.
      ""There is no one factor that will push us through the highs
  at this moment,"" Leiner said.
      Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national
  Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market,
  said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.
  Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the
  direction of bond prices over the next month.
      Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is
  around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories
  reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed
  the largest increase since 1979.
      ""The key question will be not whether there is a large
  increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is
  sustainable or a one shot deal,"" Kahan said.
      He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP
  stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on
  second quarter growth.
      If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease
  back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.

5167,"SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER OPEC PACT
  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18
  dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
  was no immediate need to change it.
      Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
  agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
  mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
  quota.
      Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
  continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
  adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
      The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
  ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
  averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
      Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
  measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
  will take place as scheduled.""
      Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
  members were abiding by its agreements.
      ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
  were not at all verified,"" he said.
      OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
  13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
  18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
      Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
  have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
  traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
      Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
  4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
      ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
  devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
  the agreement,"" he said.
      Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
  Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
  storage, Nazer said.
      King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
  Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
  stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
  competition with OPEC.
      ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
  desires price stability,"" he said.
      Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
  returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
      Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
  bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
  over-production by some OPEC states.
      ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
  by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
  mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
  members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
      Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
  quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
      But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
  OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
  necessary measures.""
      Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
  demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
  hemisphere spring and summer.
      Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
  from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
  agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
  he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
      ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
  programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
  conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
  conditions,"" Nazer said.
      He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
  -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
  they saw fit.

  Saudi Arabian business
  leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out
  problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's
  oil-dependent economy.
      The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi
  Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and
  commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.
      The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the
  mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,
  has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.
      Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce
  Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.
      Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air
  problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide
  in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in
  a private sector sorely short of finance.
      Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,
  the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private
  enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.
      The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle
  East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing
  and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.
      Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord
  reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost
  prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.
      With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the
  turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a
  52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down
  foreign reserves.
      The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of
  confidence to the business community.
      Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last
  November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the
  number of new non-performing loans.
      But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate
  finance manager in Riyadh said: ""Banks are still reluctant to
  lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am
  not sure if it is firmly based.""
      Some businessmen and bankers point out that government
  spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy
  may still be contracting.
      Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.
  A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the
  budget said: ""While industrialisation has continued to be one of
  the government's highest priorities, the recession, the
  payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi
  and foreign investor interest in industry.""
      It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a
  major issue among the businessmen gathered here.
      Official figures show the number of new licences for
  industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March
  1986, compared with the same period in 1985.
      Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major
  source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.
      Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge
  inventories of construction equipment as recession bit.
      Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.
  Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached
  agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.
      The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels
  conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a
  draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of
  bank debt.
      Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely
  to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to
  step up investment in the kingdom.
      A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after
  holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi
  outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft
  worth five billion stg.

  European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from
  2.9 pct in 1986.
      ""Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the
  demand,"" Calvet said. ""This is a relatively new problem for us.""
      Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut
  the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise
  its range and improve productivity.
      Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986
  profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.
      This weekend he said that those profit estimates ""remain
  about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic.""
      Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the
  AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be
  available throughout most of western Europe within four months.
      The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.
      It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-
  Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and
  Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of
  1,000 cars a day.
      The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model
  between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to
  compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.
      The AX had built up its market share in France to around
  four pct last month. Calvet said: ""Our hope is that once the AX
  is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent
  of the national market.""

5176,"LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL
  Leading industrial nations will meet
  again next month to review their accord on currency stability,
  but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now
  the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic
  growth.
      The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly
  suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the
  normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem
  likely to build on that stability.
      A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement
  last month was the main reason markets were calm.
      But he said in an interview that financial markets also
  understood, ""That all six countries concluded that the measures
  to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster
  stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in
  fact what has happened since Paris.""
      Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by
  the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and
  cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.
      Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but
  left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.
      The official refused to comment, however, on whether the
  agreement included a secret pact to consider further
  coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations
  have taken jointly several times in the past year.
      On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
  France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were
  within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic
  conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget
  deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.
      The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in
  future international talks.
      ""I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand
  politically and the stronger he is politically the better off
  we are with the Congress and the better off we are in
  international fora,"" said the official, an Administration
  economic policymaker. ""So it would be beneficial to the
  continued conduct of our initiatives.""
      But the official also said the Administration would resist
  calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target
  Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.
      Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to
  stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached
  1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to
  have intervened to curb sterling's strength.
      International monetary sources say finance ministers and
  central bankers, who will review market performance and their
  own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington
  just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the
  International Monetary Fund.
      The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris
  pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.
      Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,
  while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to
  show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.
      Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently
  when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told
  bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if
  the Fed was ready to follow suit.
      A Reagan Administration official said this would show there
  had been some change in approach on the part of the central
  bank in Germany.
      But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by
  the Fed and the Bundesbank.
      ""If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked
  about it, it would no longer be private,"" said the official, who
  asked not to be identified.
      Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank
  is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the
  major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.
  Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated
  action could be on the April agenda.

      Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on

5190,"ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES
  Zambia's talks with the World Bank and
  International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package
  have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an
  official newspaper said.
      The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United
  National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as
  saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing
  food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how
  it proposes to pay for them.
      President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies
  last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move
  caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots
  in which 15 people were killed.
      The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to
  quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the
  government about 500 mln kwacha per year.
      The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the
  government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the
  remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.
      The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to
  the private sector has been suspended since the end of January,
  pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and
  dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.
      The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction
  system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since
  the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine
  per dollar.
      Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank
  and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar
  on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.
      According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by
  assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude
  its talks with the government on schedule on March 23.
      The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its

5201,"GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS
  German banking authorities are
  weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an
  attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated
  capital market instruments, banking sources said.
      Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are
  under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may
  resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To
  Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of
  banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British
  proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.
      But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to
  produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.
      ""There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter
  stages,"" one representative of the German Banking Association in
  Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year.
      All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West
  Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal
  Banking Supervisory Office.
      Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes
  would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has
  been in effect since 1934.
      Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit
  present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary
  political process of changing it, banking sources said.
      Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited
  banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,
  on a consolidated basis.
      But lending ratios do not extend to several newer
  instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,
  currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,
  currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies
  and various innovative types of interest rate hedges.
      The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals
  lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,
  and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps
  than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities
  agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on
  how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.
      U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of
  formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in
  swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial
  intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.
  This is the so-called market-to-market value.
      But German authorities are likely to consider this much too
  complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of
  lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of
  the borrowers involved, the sources said.
      The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended
  to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public
  authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign
  banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.
      A further complication is that the more flexible
  definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put
  German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.
      Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of
  the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.
  And British authorities, the sources said.
      One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated
  foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be
  brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite
  the fact that the risk may be entirely different.
      How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was
  uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and
  applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in
  order to lead-manage mark eurobonds.
      But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending
  ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,
  particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they
  are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,
  the sources added.

  OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of
  oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its
  ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and
  Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.
      A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through
  Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have
  shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador
  has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.
      MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first
  week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to
  output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
      MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of
  its total production into floating storage.
      Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the
  television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,
  including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.
      The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan
  oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with
  its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower
  than that.
      It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially
  stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March
  because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still
  lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a
  further 25,000 bpd of ""purchase crude.""
      It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only
  2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift
  at official prices.
      MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member
  countries calling for the formation of a committee to study
  what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among
  various members.
      The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was
  having difficulty selling crude at official prices.
      The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries
  export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC
  price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude
  on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and
  ""other forms of hydrocarbons"" which are marketed in package deals

  President Leon Febres Cordero said
  Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
  payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
  to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
      Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was
  forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the
  slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to
  private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16
  billion dlr foreign debt.
      ""All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,"" the
  president said during a visit to the quake zone. ""A government

      Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
  would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
  to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
      He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17

  a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.
      Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a

  Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220
  mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
  wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
  recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
      But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
  postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
  months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
  members of the loan syndicate.
      The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
  ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months
  to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.
      President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
  damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that
  Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of
  interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
      Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
  price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
  export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
      Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the
  Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job
  for international financial organizations and not for
  commercial banks, bankers said.
      The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
  October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
  Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
  August 1982.
      Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
  that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
  fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
  for Latin borrowers will be set back.
      ""There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
  it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
  restructuring would look bad,"" one banker commented.

5273,"SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER PACT
  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18
  dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
  was no immediate need to change it.
      Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
  agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
  mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
  quota.
      Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
  continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
  adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
      The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
  ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
  averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
      Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
  measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
  will take place as scheduled.""
      Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
  members were abiding by its agreements.
      ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
  were not at all verified,"" he said.
      OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
  13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
  18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
      Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
  have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
  traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
      Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
  4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
      ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
  devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
  the agreement,"" he said.
      Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
  Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
  storage, Nazer said.
      King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
  Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
  stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
  competition with OPEC.
      ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
  desires price stability,"" he said.
      Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
  returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
      Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
  bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
  over-production by some OPEC states.
      ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
  by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
  mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
  members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
      Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
  quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
      But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
  OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
  necessary measures.""
      Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
  demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
  hemisphere spring and summer.
      Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
  from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
  agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
  he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
      ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
  programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
  conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
  conditions,"" Nazer said.
      He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
  -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
  they saw fit.

  which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official
  rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.
      The officials said part of the debt would be paid in
  exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.
      Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the
  door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built
  steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year
  development plan ending June 30 1992.

5345,"H AND R BLOCK &lt;HRB> SEES GAINS FROM TAX REFORM
  With the April 15 tax return deadline
  less than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging
  on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.
      Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are
  expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a
  ""bonanza,"" analysts say.
      ""For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice
  President Tom Bloch said in an interview. ""When Congress
  drastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers
  benefit,"" Bloch said.
      ""Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place
  them side by side to compare them, more people will throw their
  hands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'"" he said.
  ""Tax forms will look very different next year,"" he added.
      Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's
  fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over
  fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on
  revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987
  earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.
      ""Next year, Block could have a bonanza,"" Buchbinder said.
  Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a
  gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In
  the 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,
  up 1.5 pct over the previous year.
      The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln
  individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax
  season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax
  preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according
  to the IRS.
      For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring
  clients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,
  there are some changes in the act that will have a negative
  effect, Bloch conceded.
      Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax
  return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In
  addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the
  tax rolls, he said.
      Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to
  offset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost
  for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73
  dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up
  about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he
  said.
      Block expects ""some expansion"" this tax season of its
  electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and
  can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by

      First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block
  will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.
      Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the

  television ads. ""They may get a little more bang for their
  buck,"" he said.
      He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its
  balance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could
  be of great benefit to them.

5376,"TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U.S. CONGRESS
  U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a
  showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
  trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
  full House of Representatives in late April.
      In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
  House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of
  legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
  foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
      This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
  to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
  around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
      Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
  many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
  amendments to ""get tough"" with countries that violate trade
  agreements or keep out U.S. products.
       On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance
  to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in
  trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating
  powers.
      Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's
  bill was not one ""that a free trader like me could endorse in
  all respects,"" but he emphasized there was a consensus among
  trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans
  would ultimately endorse.
      Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, ""to make our
  trade policy stronger without violating our international trade
  agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not
  done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't
  avoided violating agreements.""
      In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful
  chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade
  subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
  Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports
  from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
      It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would
  hurt the U.S. economy.
      Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois
  Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if
  the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.
      Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a
  tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this
  year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he
  saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.
      As an indication of his success, White House spokesman
  Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still
  did not like some provisions. But he added, ""Generally we feel
  very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
  legislation. I think we are progressing very well.""
      The first battle will take place next week when the full
  House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
  Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such
  as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses
  with the United States.
      The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
  that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
  States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
  but would not automatically set off retaliation.
      Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free
  trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.
      Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
  imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
  AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
  administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would
  sign would not be worth passage in Congress.
      But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a
  statement, ""I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
  Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
  by the president.""
      In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
  trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
      Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold
  off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect
  the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan
  vetoed a similar measure last year.
      House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the
  most influential proponents of aid for specific industries
  beset by low priced foreign competition.
      Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the
  domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate
  plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports
  reach half of domestic consumption.
      For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.
  enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration
  to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as
  dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost
  of production.
      It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an
  industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its
  existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the
  U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car
  imports in 1981.

  Endotronics Inc said it expects to
  incur ""substantial losses"" for the second quarter ending March
  31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987.
      As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics
  cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, &lt;Yamaha
  Inc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.
      In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts
  receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another
  Japanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.
      Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations
  it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit
  facilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of
  the remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit
  from Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp
  &lt;CZ>.
      The company said its ability to obtain funding was
  adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its
  shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against
  three officers of Endotronics.
      Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges
  violations of the federal securities laws in connection with
  statements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.
      The company also said the Securities Division of the
  Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into
  the company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by
  insiders and brokers in the company's common shares.
      It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the
  Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will
  hurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.
      As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory
  note, the law suit challenging its financial data and the
  various investigations concerning insider trading, the company
  said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in
  instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by
  increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the
  United States.

5394,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY
  The European Monetary System marks its
  eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money
  markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability
  in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,
  which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow
  fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.
      Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has
  been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike
  seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.
      And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as
  Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality
  when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.
      But economists say members such as West Germany have so far
  blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's
  founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
  former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
      Under this phase, originally due to have started two years
  after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been
  transferred from national governments and central banks to an
  autonomous European Monetary Fund.
      But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in
  economic and monetary matters. ""The basic problem of the EMS is
  that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a
  situation where certain decisions are taken in common,"" said one
  economist who has closely watched the system's development.
      The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on
  third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the
  system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.
      Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and
  investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp
  rise of the West German mark severely strained the system.
      Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the
  EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world
  currency, outside the system.
      No change in the British government's attitude is expected
  before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.
      Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it
  was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's
  highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central
  Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.
      Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers
  hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.
      But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve
  more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical
  about the chances for any fundamental change.
      ""Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS
  against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we
  must take the step forward to the institutional level,"" said Leo
  de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.
      Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend
  largely on the success of an agreement last month among major
  industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar
  resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they
  predict.

  The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange
  controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with
  European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the
  ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said.
      ""The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift
  restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with
  deregulation in the banking industry,"" he said in a telephone
  interview.
      The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls
  highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday.
      The central bank said in a statement the measures included
  increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision
  for future pension fund obligations.
      It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate
  Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the
  Community last year.
      Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a
  process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign
  banks to open branches.
      Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and
  they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets.
      Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign
  currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a
  previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas.
      The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that
  date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the
  country on new foreign currency loans.
      The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion
  pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be
  given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days.
      Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign
  currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by
  issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper.
      They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign
  issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits.
      Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,
  instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency.
      The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the
  amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited
  to three times a bank's capital equity.
      The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most
  bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which
  imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta
  funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates.
      The reserve requirement, which was already in place on
  normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign
  speculative capital which is entering the country and
  threatening the government's money supply growth target.
      A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now
  account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a
  disadvantage with European competitors.
      The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements
  to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of
  interest rate deregulation. ""The real problem is the freeing of
  interest rates,"" the banker said. ""This is going to take a big
  bite out of profits.""
      The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid
  on deposits of up to 180 days.
      The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the
  measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this
  year.

5473,"ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION
  &lt;Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique
  among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global
  expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its
  yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.
      First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst
  Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is
  attainable. But it ""will be a tremendous achievement because
  ... they're going to have to build an international earnings
  base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic
  trust companies,"" Walsh said.
      Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's
  154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth
  this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company
  profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.
      He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26
  pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.
      Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with
  assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated
  internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.
      Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when
  other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and
  loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.
      The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened
  domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank
  operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,
  Cornelissen said.
      Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and
  Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical
  Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset
  management, merchant and private banking companies.
      ""It was a heaven-sent opportunity,"" Cornelissen said of the
  Dow Financial acquisition. ""We achieved in one year what would
  otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.""
      Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct
  competition with major global financial institutions in
  activities such as international lending and stock brokerage,
  in order to exploit ""profitable niches"" overseas in traditional
  trust activities such as asset management, private banking and
  advisory services.
      He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations
  ""before the end of this month"" to sell its London-based Savory
  Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.
      ""The international market is so big and we have such a
  miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really
  limited only by our energy and our desire to find more
  business,"" he said, adding that in trust-type services, ""we
  don't think the international markets are well-served.""
      Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign 
  investment interest in North America and increased Canadian
  investment abroad, Cornelissen said.
      Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid
  economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said
  Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion
  dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.
      Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia
  will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of
  global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, ""We knew we had
  to be there."" Royal Trust's 14 international locations include
  offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also
  recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
      The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing
  growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any
  acquisitions in the ""immediate future,"" although ""we have our
  eyes wide open for the right opportunities.""
      Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the
  company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,
  Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well
  covered by hundreds of small regional banks.
      ""That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,""
  said Cornelissen. ""That is probably one area that we will
  probably do something with in the next five years.""
      He said the company would continue to emphasize its home
  Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services
  analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.
      Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,
  trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in
  one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition
  for Royal Trust, ""but not drastically more,"" Cornelissen said.

  Salomon Brothers Inc said it raised
  its opinion on Caterpillar Inc's stock to an aggressive buy
  from a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988.
      Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees
  1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecast
  of three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at
  2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.
      Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.
      ""Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,
  we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second
  half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through
  1988 and 1989,"" he said.
      Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors
  - higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and
  improved demand.
      The higher prices will stick because its Japanese
  competitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of the
  increased value of the yen, he said.

  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said
  ""significant progress"" was being made in trade talks with the

      Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons,
  Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in
  Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries.
      Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, said
  that while the negotiations were risky and difficult, ""a
  profile of a major trade deal is now emerging.""
    In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionate
  defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas
  of the country a major economic boost.
      ""Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades,
  we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is
  rich and promising, one that is under-developed and
  under-employed,"" said Mulroney.
      ""What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British
  Columbians and Albertans and others, that they get their
  chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way
  to prosperity.""
      Few detials have been released on the trade talks which
  were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that
  are each others most important trading partners.
      Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade
  sources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal
  and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many
  non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.
      It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is
  a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes,
  something that would give Canada protection from Washington's
  tough trade remedy laws.
      But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment
  in the U.S, said Canada was a ""fair trader"" and denied the
  government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the
  American market.
      He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides.

5561,"TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE
  U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a
  showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
  trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
  full House of Representatives in late April.
      In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
  House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of
  legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
  foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
      The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
  to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
  around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
      Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement
  of trade laws.
      The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on
  complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products
  in the United States at prices below cost of production. It
  also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry
  complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.
      In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
  trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
      Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
  many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
  amendments to ""get tough"" with countries that violate trade
  agreements or keep out U.S. products.
      But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade
  said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes
  and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.
      Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not
  one ""that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,""
  but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work
  toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.
      The goal of trade legislation was ""to make our trade policy
  stronger without violating our international trade agreements,""
  he said.
      In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means
  Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade
  subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
  Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports
  from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
      It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if
  it would hurt the U.S. economy.
      Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was
  necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign
  into law.
      Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough
  House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he
  only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw
  Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late
  last week that the administration still did not like some of
  the bill's provisions, but he added, ""Generally we feel very
  good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
  legislation. I think we are progressing very well.""
      The first battle will take place next week when the full
  House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
  Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South
  Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.
      The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
  that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
  States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
  but would not automatically set off retaliation.
      Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
  imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
      AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
  administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign
  would not be worth passage in Congress.
      But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by
  saying, ""I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
  Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
  by the president.""
      Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill
  to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide
  said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.
      House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most
  influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by
  low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for
  import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his
  support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import
  tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

  Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an
  agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its
  Fairchild Semiconductor operations.
      The company said the rising political controversy in the
  U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of
  the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable
  time.
      The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department
  and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security
  grounds.
      The company said termination of the agreement opened other
  possibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of the
  semiconductor maker by Fairchild management.
      In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoing
  business within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concern
  said.
      Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of the
  Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in
  the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up
  recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth
  quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.
      Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but
  industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about
  200 mln dlrs.
      The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.
  Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
  Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations
  about the transaction since it was announced.
      Government officials have expressed concern that the sale
  could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting
  key advanced technology into Japanese hands.
      New, high-technology semiconductors are used in
  supercomputers, which are faster and more powerful than
  existing computers.

  The trade surplus doubled in
  february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below
  the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.
      The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade
  department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in
  February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled
  1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after
  excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below
  the same month last year.
      Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln
  in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.
      Fendt said that although the February results were lower
  than the average expected for the rest of the year, the
  government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987
  should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of
  9.5 billion dlrs.
      Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs
  and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled
  22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.
      Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion
  dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with
  government plans to foster economic growth.
      Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above
  the traditional average for Brazil.
      In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil
  and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in
  the same 1986 period.
      This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian
  industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly
  compatible with the government's program for economic growth,

      Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM>,
  Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might also
  seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust
  problems, the analysts added.
      Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be
  considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,
  Calif., company, analysts said.
      In a brief statement announcing the termination of the
  agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened
  up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by
  Fairchild management.
      The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would
  have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,
  because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan
  administration made it unlikely that the sale could be
  completed within a reasonable period of time.
      Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that
  the companies did not need government approval to complete the
  transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned
  companies.
      ""Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because
  the U.S. government didn't want it,"" said Johnson of L.F.
  Rothschild.
      A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the
  company's news release.
      He said only that the company was reviewing a number of
  possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.
      Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately
  available for comment.
      Analysts noted the significance of the government's
  apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of
  Fairchild.
      Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
  feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control
  of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military
  weapons systems.
      ""The government really stood up for the semiconductor
  industry,"" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. ""That, I think, is
  the real significance of this.""
      Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might
  now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about
  Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade
  agreement signed last summer.

5692,"BRAZIL'S TRADE SURPLUS DOUBLED IN FEBRUARY
  Brazil's trade surplus doubled
  in February to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln but was well
  below the 628 mln dlrs of February last year, official figures
  show.
      Director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade department
  (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February
  confirmed a rising trend in exports which totalled 1.53 billion
  dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding
  coffee and oil derivatives, was only slightly below the same
  month last year.
      Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln
  in February, 1986, because of lower prices, he added.
      Fendt said although the February results were lower than
  the average expected for the rest of the year, the government's
  target of an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be
  achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion
  dlrs.
      Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs
  and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled
  22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.
      Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion
  dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with
  government plans to foster economic growth.
      Fendt said imports were running at levels well above the
  traditional average for Brazil.
      Imports in the first two months of the year, excluding oil
  and wheat, totalled 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in
  the same 1986 period.
      This rise reflected industry's need for equipment to raise
  production and is perfectly compatible with the government's
  program for economic growth, Fendt added.

5710,"ICAHN SAYS HE IS TARGET OF SEC INVESTIGATION
  Corporate raider Carl Icahn
  acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation
  by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible
  violations of securities laws.
      Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc
  &lt;TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to
  make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.
      The SEC issued a formal order launching the private
  investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.
      The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out
  whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws
  and related rules, Icahn said.
      Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and
  subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain
  unspecified companies, he said.
      Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals
  who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in
  companies of at least five pct within 10 days.
      Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in
  connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has
  disclosed that he is among those being investigated.
      By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is
  obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also
  alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.
      It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they
  or their officers are the targets of government probes to
  acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret
  investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements
  to their shareholders.
      Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others
  whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and
  selling more than five pct of a company's stock.
      SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities
  law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe
  into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to
  published reports.
      Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount
  of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making
  no filing at all could indicate a scheme to ""warehouse"" shares
  of stock.
      In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in
  concert would each amass stock in the company without
  disclosing that they have an agreement among them.
      By failing to disclose that they are acting together the
  market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is
  controlled by a group acting in concert.
      Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg
  family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while
  it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.

  SmithKline Beckman Corp said it is
  pursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct
  annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder
  of the decade.
      In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per
  share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.
      The company said in its annual report that its
  nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting
  its earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than
  its pharmaceutical business.
      SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication
  Tagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings
  from existing products, expand its product portfolio and
  optimize its financial resources.
      To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which
  Tagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategy
  to develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered
  by two joint ventures, one with &lt;Wellcome PLC>, and one pending
  venture in Japan.
      SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care
  products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the
  next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct
  annually.
      ""Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility,"" Gavin
  Herbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said
  in the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln
  dlrs.
      It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories
  pharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will
  file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a
  number of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen
  activator, over the next two years.
      It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct
  larger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.
      Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing
  unit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a
  year, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in
  testing for the AIDS antibody.
      Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the
  cost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last three
  years, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.
      SmithKline begins the year with a new management team,
  including its new chief operating officer George Ebright.

  down debt. ""However, it is difficult to determine now whether
  this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating

      Sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding the

  Buoyed by low fuel prices and
  favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's
  &lt;CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's
  forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.
      Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings
  of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports
  results tomorrow for its first year as a public company.
      Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, made
  its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in
  May last year.
      Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making
  a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the
  prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.
      They said the airline's performance improved in the second
  half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln
  dlrs.
      The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one
  U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's
  favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time
  of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.
      James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline
  industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the
  1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would
  affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits
  of 1.25 billion dlrs.
       Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and
  currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.
      ""This is reflected in their interim results which showed
  that profit margin has increased,"" said Frederick Tsang of
  Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.
      Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier
  levels, but profits rose 69 pct.
      The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on
  the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices
  usually lag behind crude price movements by several months,
  analysts said.
      By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the
  Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and
  sterling 12 pct.
      ""Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against
  Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields
  in the first half up 7.2 pct,"" said James Capel. ""This should
  continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to
  end the year up 7.6 pct.""
      A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash
  under management also improved profits, James Capel said.
      A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed
  to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor
  declined because of increased competition and an expansion of
  its fleet and services.
      James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown
  last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown
  climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell
  to 68.8 pct from 70 pct.
      ""Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes
  last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,""
  said Tsang. ""This affected its load factor.""
      Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier &lt;Hong

  A government study has concluded the
  U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the
  next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,
  the New York Times said.
      The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found
  a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling
  domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.
      The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying
  on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak
  of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during
  the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
      The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from
  27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.
      It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy
  Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise
  domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the
  current 8.4 mln barrels.
      The newspaper said the administration has placed increased
  emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held
  is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times
  of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,
  rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.
     The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the
  depletion allowance to major producers.
      ""The administration also plans to renew its efforts to
  ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on
  the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the
  use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers,"" it added.
      The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma

  Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated
  the amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

  China's grain imports will rise
  in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but
  will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and
  Japanese traders told Reuters.
      They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy
  would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked
  at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.
      An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put
  maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73
  mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.
      Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor
  harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports,
  which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.
      ""China is short of foreign exchange,"" the Shanghai official
  said. ""We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world
  prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a
  major importer.""
      A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports
  would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,
  low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and
  animal consumption.
      ""At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain
  it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly
  needs,"" the trader said.
      The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is
  affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce
  the summer grain harvest from last year's level.
      The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying
  enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it
  difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln
  tonnes against 391 mln in 1986.
      ""All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest
  area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and
  high-yield cash crops,"" it said.
      It added factory production might have to be reduced to
  provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight
  the drought.
      Since January, the press has devoted much attention to
  grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's
  economic and political stability and that prices paid to
  farmers are too low.
      Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain
  production is a key state policy and outlined the measures
  being taken in their areas to encourage output.
      The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of
  the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise
  agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set
  aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the
  70,000 workers available to help farmers.
      Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside
  Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three
  years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.
      Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of
  Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain
  output in his province.
      ""In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,
  raising the level of science and technology on the farms and
  improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other
  infrastructure,"" he said.
      The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in
  industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their
  spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,
  they lease the land to grain farmers.
      The China Daily said last month that grain output should
  reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480
  and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made
  profitable.
      ""The advantages the state promises grain growers actually
  yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by
  intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.
  Only this will boost enthusiasm,"" it said.

5808,"FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY
  Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB.N> decision to
  end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> to buy
  80 pct of its &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the political
  furore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese
  companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High
  technology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry
  analysts said.
      The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to
  Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by
  the Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.
      ""The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's
  North American operations, but it would have been a great
  boost,"" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.
      French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending
  the agreement because mounting political controversy in the
  U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake
  could be completed in a reasonable time.
      The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and
  Defence Department, partly on national security grounds.
      Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the
  Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North
  American sales and distribution system and access to
  microprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,
  analysts said.
      The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional
  microchip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the
  U.S., A report by the Capel firm said.
      ""It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a
  marketing channel for other things,"" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd
  analyst Rick May.
      Several analysts said the purchase would not have given
  Fujitsu access to critical defence technology.
      ""(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a
  thing of the past,"" May said.
      The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as
  it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to
  modernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said.
      The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese
  firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High
  tech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.
      Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly
  route of expanding its own production and distribution
  facilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the
  estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to
  acquire some less politically symbolic firm.
      ""It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the
  necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in
  America remains,"" said Capel's Murtha. ""The Japanese will
  continue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find
  ones that are politically acceptable.""
      Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or
  smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash
  that blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. ""They're not
  going to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...
  Because of the political risk,"" said Barclays de Zoete's May.
      Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct
  shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super
  minicomputer makers, he said.
      Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up
  harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational
  tie-ups, some analysts said.
      ""This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either,"" said
  Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. ""The
  pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --
  why should the government step in to prevent it?""
      Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime
  Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.
  Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.
      ""This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter
  for governments' comment,"" Tamura said. ""I think it was improper
  for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they
  did,"" he said.
      A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is that
  international investment flows ought to be free and that such
  flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing
  closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

      They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month

      South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped

      The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to
  import Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.
      The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one
  step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea

  Japanese officials sought to convince the
  U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead
  of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their
  case.
      ""We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the
  situation does not run counter to the pact,"" Osamu Watanabe,
  Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's
  (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters.
      ""The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking
  are emerging in the market place,"" he said.
      U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese
  microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at
  below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States.
      The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting
  predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S.
  Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market.
      The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime
  Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on
  the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said.
      Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics
  Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below
  cost in third countries.
      MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut
  production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this
  year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in
  the non-regulated grey market, Honda said.
      ""The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but
  in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding
  market share because of their cheaper prices,"" Honda said.
      MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess
  supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the
  pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor
  exports to the United States, he added.
      The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines
  for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are
  likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said.
      Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any
  artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should
  bring positive results, Watanabe said. ""I am optimistic,"" he
  added.

5858,"DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY
  Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,
  and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan
  takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris
  accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.
      ""The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of
  150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,"" a senior dealer
  at one leading bank said.
      The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at
  around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a
  meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.
      Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,
  but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed
  inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.
  Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.
      Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package
  Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its
  trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would
  probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.
      Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of
  measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost
  domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.
      But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition
  boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition
  of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim
  chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near
  future, the dealers said.
      If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on
  the dollar, they said.
      The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed
  since before the Paris accord, they added.
      ""Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to
  a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt
  crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest
  payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the
  Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms
  scandal,"" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.
      ""There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to
  around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,"" said Chemical Bank
  Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.
      But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way
  for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.
      Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.
  Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for
  quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar
  when it rose to 1.87 marks.
      The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London
  when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.
      But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central
  bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline
  because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying
  intervention as a chance to sell dollars.
      However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch
  assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said ""The dollar will not
  show drastic movement at least to the end of March.""
      Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any
  strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books
  for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar
  would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on
  their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in
  purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.
      U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any
  comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said.

5870,"DUTCH PORT EMPLOYERS RESUME LAY-OFF PLANS
  Employers in Rotterdam's troubled
  general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy
  procedures within a week, employers' organisation labour
  relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters.
      Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the
  employers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption
  of eight weeks of strikes in the sector.
      The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim
  court injunction against the employers' plans for 350
  redundancies this year.
      A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made
  an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission
  for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a
  final ruling on May 7.
      Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well
  take up to two months, but the employers were not prepared
  simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the
  chance they would have to start all over again in any case.
      ""We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The
  strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business,
  and further delays would do even more damage,"" Zeebregts said.
      The campaign of lightning strikes in the port's general
  cargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans
  for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 strong workforce
  by 1990, starting with 350 this year.

  The European Community (EC) yesterday
  warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners,
  that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations
  with both countries.
      EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's
  continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make
  a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they
  were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that
  would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were
  prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already
  distanced itself from the bill.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written
  to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
  outlining the EC's concerns.
      The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.
  Moves towards protectionism. ""The adoption of such measures
  would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of
  multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral
  relations,"" it said.
      Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but
  to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade, it said.
      In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said
  they ""deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in
  trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.""
      The statement said the EC would continue to insist that
  Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.
      Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a
  report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them
  to take appropriate action where necessary.
      One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers
  were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. ""It will
  be back on the table again and again,"" the diplomat said.
      De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,
  ""There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the
  Community concerning trade relations with Japan.""
      But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo
  to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and
  damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more
  cooperation with Japan in industry and research.

  Already strained relations between
  the U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to get
  worse before they get better, director general of the Dutch
  Economics Ministry's foreign affairs division Frans Engering
  said.
      Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The
  Hague, Engering noted the developing history of crises over
  steel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.
      ""I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus
  ill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous
  provocation,"" he said. ""I feel that we shall probably have to
  deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future.""
      Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get
  the American balance of payments into better shape, but the
  risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has
  its own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engering
  noted.
      ""If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that
  we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war,
  then I think the answer is probably yes,"" he said.
      In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in the
  EC must become less self-centred, and the US Administration
  will have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and
  pressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.

  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
  said an agreement has been reached by members of the

  control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote
  trade.
      He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan

      The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed

5973,"OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS
  The western industrialised nations have
  agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for
  exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development said.
      The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to
  subsidise export credits in so-called ""mixed credits,"" the OECD
  said.
      The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this
  year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed
  credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for
  credits covering exports to the world's least developed
  nations.
      Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating
  the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different
  interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,
  which hosted the reform negotiations, said.
      Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade
  loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the
  subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively
  rich developing countries by July next year.
      The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To
  stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid
  to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
      OECD officials said the agreement was based on a
  provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification
  by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had
  linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which
  would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.
      By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed
  credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too
  costly for frequent use.
      ""A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
  Trade has been closed today,"" a senior U.S. Official here
  commented.

  Exxon Corp, the world's largest oil

  close on of its french refineries.
      Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the
  possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France
  during the interview.
      An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had
  specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no
  specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of
  Exxon's opertations were under constant review.
      Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the
  mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and
  Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.
      Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade
  journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that
  Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in
  Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.
      Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said
  that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the
  improvement in the European refining situation, its future
  profits there should be good.
      ""Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of
  refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the
  indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products
  rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior
  earnings,"" Mlotok said.
      ""Just after Royal Dutch &lt;RD>, they are seen as one of the
  highest grade refiners in Europe,"" he added.
      Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to
  feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe
  where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as
  these producers move further into downstream operations.
      PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect
  increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export
  refineries.
      PIW said ""sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are
  expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European
  refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last

  Zambia will reintroduce a modified

  new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard
  Chivuno said.
      Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks
  of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that
  there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions
  and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types
  of business.
      The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to
  distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine
  the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end
  of January.
      President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was
  suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation
  and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had
  resulted.
      Business and banking sources said another reason for
  suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on
  foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful
  bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system
  was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15
  per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.
      Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of
  about nine kwacha per dollar.

6086,"LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE
  Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil
  producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging
  developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost
  opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland
  Revenue said in a post-budget statement.
      Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced
  in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies
  will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
  development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
  Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).
      To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an
  individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was
  not immediately available against other development
  expenditure, the statement said.
      The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern
  basin for which development
  consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the
  post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies
  to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.
      Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow
  certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at
  present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT
  liability.
      This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the
  U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a
  particular field within three years of being incurred, to be
  allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland
  Revenue said.
      This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more
  in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to
  encourage general research into ways of reducing field
  development costs, it said.
      In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln
  stg a year, it calculated.
      The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical
  measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.
      These included measures to allow companies to balance their
  shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two
  past periods of allowance utilisation.
      Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs
  were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on
  corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the
  so-called ""ring fence"" of activities in the U.K. And its
  continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for
  the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.
      Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers
  Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs
  on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.
      He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would
  favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields
  such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.
      Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields
  might also be encouraged, he said.
      Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore
  construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs
  under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.
      He pointed out that the relief only applies to the
  development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.
      This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the
  central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than
  in the south and thus have greater capital and labour
  requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.
      He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure
  would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although
  the benefits of this research would not be seen for several
  year.

      The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made

     Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20
  pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their
  stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.
      The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to
  close discussions within the government due to legal queries
  over the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministry
  official said.
      Although bought by French citizens they are managed by
  foreign banks &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and

  Algemene Bank Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.
      CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone
  switching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mln
  francs by private tender.
      Five groups are bidding for the company and the government
  has said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.
      APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a
  capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, but
  declined to give details or say how an increase would affect
  foreign stakes in CGCT.
      In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of
  three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.

  to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production

      The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for

  British bank base lending rates are
  likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this
  week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.
  Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in
  today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.
      The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money
  markets had already started to reward.
      Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money
  market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget
  measures came through, the analysts said.
      Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he
  expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.
      ""This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get
  interest rates down,"" he said.
      Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely
  discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month
  interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and
  it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a
  half-point cut now.
      Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,
  too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,
  but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.
      ""This budget is designed to please both the markets and the
  electorate. The implications for interest rates are very
  favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another
  such cut before the end of the week,"" Simmonds said.
      Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he
  said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut
  in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.
  ""There is no real need to boost private consumption,"" he said.
      National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said
  the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the
  likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.
      Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,
  in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the
  sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point
  base rate cut could be implemented.
   But providing the budget small-print was convincing, ""and I
  suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one
  point off base rates by the end of this week,"" Kern said.
      Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave
  the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.
  This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer
  price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.
      U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11
  pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money
  and government bonds (gilts) markets.
      But building societies said they would not cut lending
  rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.

  A White House-ordered report said 
  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
  could have potentially damaging implications for national
  security.
      The Energy Department study discusses several options to
  curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
      President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
  out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
  the depressed domestic oil industry.
      Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
  ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
  years, this report shows that there is justification for
  national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
  domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""
      The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
  consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
      Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
  oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
      President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
  determination that the country never again become captive to a
  foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
  sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
      The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
  make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
  oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
  depress the nation's economy.

  Coastal Corp said it expected earnings

      In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company's
  newly-issued 1986 annual report, Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt
  did not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to
  increase.
      The 1986 profits of Coastal, a natural gas production and
  pipeline company, were halved from 1985 levels due to slumping
  energy prices. The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrs
  last year.
      Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average
  price of 2.17 dlrs per mcf in 1986, a drop of 18 pct from the
  previous year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average
  14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.
      The Houston-based company, which produced a daily average
  of 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11,149 barrels of oil, said it
  had proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28.6 mln barrels of oil

  an eventual oil import fee in the
  united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum
  corp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de
  venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.
      ""this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the
  negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all
  eventualities in this regard,"" he told reuters during the
  signing ceremony here.
      Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez
  grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa
  buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as ""one more
  step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in
  world markets.""
     union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will
  be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of
  supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.
      ""we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time
  of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are
  clear benefits to both sides,"" he said.
      Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with
  an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over
  the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan
  heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and
  obtain a competitive product yield.
      ""therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a
  consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen
  what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact
  on today's agreement,"" adams said.
      He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as
  venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any
  difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet
  to take advantage of bigger margins.
      The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of
  venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct
  yield of white products.

      The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which

  Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost
  three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group
  proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.
      However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from
  the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how
  high bidding for the company would go and whether the company
  would agree to a takeover.
      ""There are too many uncertainties,"" said one arbitrager.
      Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.
      Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital
  Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they
  were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company
  and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150
  dlrs per share.
      The company responded that the proposal would be submitted
  to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been
  made on a sale of the company.
      ""Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per
  share),"" said one arbitrager.
      Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current
  levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share
  range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level
  would be chancy since it will take a long time for any
  transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals
  necessary for the broadcast properites.
      Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion
  dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected
  the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,
  its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives
  such as restructuring.
      Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,
  which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by
  Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial
  Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds
  16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50
  years ago, has about 12 pct.
      Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange
  Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.
      ""I could see if things got really crazy that it might go

6163,"HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS
  Energy Secretary John Herrington
  said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil
  industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and
  head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
      He said also at a news conference that he would recommend
  to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic
  Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels
  per day.
      The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a
  day.
      Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate
  for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down
  because of budgetary constraints.
      Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might
  advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax
  benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and
  development into new ways to extract oil which is now
  considered uneconomical to produce.
      He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the
  Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.
      Herrington said that before he disclosed what
  recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry
  he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House
  Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase
  oil production made good tax policy.
      He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one
  mln barrels a day.
      The report said that by the end of the century the United
  States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil
  consumption, posing a serious economic and national security
  threat.

  A White House-ordered report said 
  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
  could have potentially damaging implications for national
  security.
      The Energy Department study discusses several options to
  curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
      President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
  out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
  the depressed domestic oil industry.
      Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
  ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
  years, this report shows that there is justification for
  national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
  domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""
      The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
  consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
      Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
  oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
      President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
  determination that the country never again become captive to a
  foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
  sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
      The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
  make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
  oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
  depress the nation's economy.
      The study was outlined in a New York Times report today.

  OPEC believes world oil prices should
  be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC
  Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.
      In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar
  in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: ""OPEC believes
  ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions
  and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.""
      But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had
  caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to
  curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC
  states could not be sustained in some cases.
      ""For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now
  considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member
  countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing
  production,"" Al-Wattari said.
      ""Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,""
  Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,
  some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use
  and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.
      Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
  organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in
  February, although this had meant sacrifices.
      The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,
  though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,
  Al-Wattari said. ""A lasting stability in the world market
  requires a wider scope of international cooperation,"" he added.
      He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a
  political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.
      But although cutbacks announced by these states were
  politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were
  insufficient in terms of volume, he added. ""The overall majority
  of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's
  calls for supply regulation,"" he said.
      Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it
  allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to
  continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for
  otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price
  would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.
      Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also
  addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed
  to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.
      Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous
  for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation
  would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.

  The U.K. Government forecasts that oil
  revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year
  1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in
  1985/86.
      The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and
  Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer
  Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.
      The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15
  dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil
  revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining
  close to current levels, the Treasury document said.
      The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will
  reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation
  tax is paid after a time lag.
      The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference
  in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln
  stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full
  year.
      Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,
  according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in
  production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88
  and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.
      Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now
  estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the
  1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,
  despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.
      Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion
  stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the
  overshoot.
      Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to
  168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,
  besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of
  40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.
      Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5
  billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in
  1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,
  compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this
  fiscal year.
      The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal
  year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised
  164.9 billion in the current year.
      A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and

      The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the rise
  in the stock today was likely the result of ""U.S. investors
  that were not completely cognizant of the size or the

      Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings
  estimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share

      O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to
  build a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture

  produces dry baby food cereal.
      He said Heinz-Japan is ""making a profit and generating its

  South Korea.
      To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz
  implemented a ""lowest cost imaginable"" program targeted at
  manufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.

  Allegheny Beverage Corp said it
  has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its
  foodservice unit, Service America Corp.
      The group includes senior management of Service America but
  no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said.
      The company has agreed to permit the group and its
  potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service
  America, it said.
      Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin
  off the foodservice subsidiary.
      The company said the group's review is preliminary and
  there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made
  or, if made, accepted.
      Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln
  dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of
  1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a
  spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said.
      He declined to identify the Service America officials in
  the acquisition group.
      On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin
  off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It
  said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America
  to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
      Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985,
  operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
  Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated
  laundry services, building maintenance services and retail
  office and furniture operations.
      In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing
  operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share,
  excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations
  and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985,
  Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc
  &lt;PEP> for 160 mln dlrs.
      Including discontinued operations and the special item, net
  income was 59.8 mln dlrs or 6.21 dlrs a share fully diluted.

6225,"PERU TO SELL 40 STATE FIRMS TO CUT BUDGET DEFICIT
  peru will sell about 40 state-owned firms
  to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among
  government-owned companies.
      Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others
  would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino,
  president of the government's state company holding firm, the
  national development council (conade).
       He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to
  slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion
  intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all
  or part of the companies.
      Independent economists warn that the deficit could push
  inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the
  govenment target of 40-50 pct.
      Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline
  with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private
  investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in
  eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.
      Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said
  the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold,
  including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock
  exchange.
      Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the
  possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another
  manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold
  in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern
  state of  arequipa.
      Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique
  estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners
  would be allowed to purchase the companies. Their secretaries
  said they were out of their offices.
      Jose antonio almenara, the general manager of the lima
  stock exchange, where shares of the state-owned firms could be
  sold, told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase
  stock at the exchange had to be tax-paying residents of peru.
      He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad
  until at least july 1988.

  The Reagan administration will
  consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive
  industries such as semiconductors and computers, the New York
  Times said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.
      ""I think there's a strong sentiment here that some
  industries are not totally up for grabs,"" the paper quoted the
  official as saying.
      ""Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and
  computer companies,"" said the official, who the newspaper said
  was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd
  &lt;ITSU.T> takeover bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>.
      The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and
  industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan
  administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition
  in the important computer chip manufacturing industry.
      Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought
  the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger
  Ltd &lt;SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could
  have left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for
  vital technology.
      The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had
  come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.
      ""Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have
  to be some exceptions for the national interest,"" Baldrige was
  quoted as saying.
      The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to
  bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency
  policymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's
  Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security
  Council.

  The Philippines' Social Security System

      He told reporters the government organisation had expressed
  interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to
  invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a
  share.
      The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block
  of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank
  (UCPB) and sequestered by the government.
      The block is split between class A and class B stock.
      SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N.
  Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres
  Soriano, del Rosario said.
      The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.
      Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are
  open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to
  unidentified foreign purchasers.
      He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to
  resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares.
      President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an
  arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the
  shares.
      Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit
  Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on
  Good Government.
      The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the

  More U.S. And European firms will be
  falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and
  eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to
  merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.
      Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.
  Banks, steel and other businesses.
      In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's
  biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild
  Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies
  components for supercomputers.
      Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co
  Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking
  a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the
  country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas
  banking, the takeover specialists said.
      Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating
  in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all
  have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.
      Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most
  pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto
  makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.
      ""The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up
  potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --
  Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,"" a
  takeover specialist at one trading company said.
      Japanese companies have become among the world's richest
  after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed
  against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.
      But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of
  Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into
  its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,
  the specialists said.
      Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more
  barriers against Japanese exports.
      Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid
  the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.
  Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little
  investment opportunity.
      ""Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but
  the recent economic factors have become a driving force,"" said a
  banking industry source.
      So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.
      While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in
  the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have
  totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.
      Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese
  acquisition activity was originally expected five years from
  now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.
      Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.
      A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals
  Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.
  Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he
  added.
      Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for
  550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid
  for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire
  business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all
  but its graphic arts-related businesses.
      Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon
  by the Japanese, the trading company official says. ""Japanese
  people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable
  deals."" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese
  companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. ""This is
  a healthy progression.""
      However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the
  board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.
      ""Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a
  large U.S. Or European corporation,"" one banker said. ""They will
  expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for
  Japanese business.""
      A foreign merchant banker also noted, ""There are not many
  mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big
  deals there have already been done.""
      But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of
  Japanese companies, the specialists said.
      Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in
  high-technology areas. ""Japanese companies had used technology
  and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate
  from that trend,"" one takeover specialist said.
      Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If
  these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.
      But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait
  until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading
  houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and
  foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as
  go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

6352,"THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT
  Officials of five Thai commercial banks
  are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting
  interest rates, banking sources said.
      They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur
  domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity
  on the money market.
      Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage
  point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending
  rates, they said.
      Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and
  overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16
  but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the
  sources said.
      Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early
  last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current
  gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit
  and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.
      Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about
  40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created
  problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.
      Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly
  because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.
  The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai
  banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion
  in bank deposits.
      Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have
  further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.
      The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday
  recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up
  4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.
      Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register
  more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.
      Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will
  grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for
  local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of
  bank capital.
      If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry
  date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign
  exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.
      Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht
  of surplus funds to the local money market.

  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HK>
  forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in
  both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over
  the year-earlier period.
      The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987
  but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co &lt;BA.N> 747
  freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September
  and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.
      It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit
  to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14
  cents a share.
      But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance
  charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.
      A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft
  deliveries in 1986.
      However, the company said in a statement good returns from
  funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher
  interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and
  other borrowing.
      It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel
  prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in
  1985.
      Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last
  year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre
  travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. But
  passenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct.
      The airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in
  total tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in
  revenue to 1.79 billion dlrs.

  Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> group net income is
  expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31
  from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if
  the yendollar rate remains at the present level, managing
  director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.
      Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending
  March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from
  April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.
      Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550
  billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.
      The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen
  in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from
  a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.
      The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent
  appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market
  prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.
      The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,
  reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by
  40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.
      Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units
  in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while
  Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000
  from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000
  from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from
  1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one
  mln due to lower exports to China.
      Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs
  sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.
  Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three
  months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.
      Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total
  production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.
      Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month
  period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from
  a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.
      Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group
  net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April
  1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net
  profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a
  year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.

      This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares

      The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all

  dlrs each.
      Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the

  it has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorp
  Inc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rights
  for 100 dlrs a share.
      GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at
  90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.
      In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said the
  offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.
      General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt
  of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted
  basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at
  least 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.
      It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming
  the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that
  the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining
  from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary
  authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp
  shares.
      General Partners said it would set up voting trust
  arrangements pending review of its long-form application for
  FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's
  broadcasting subsidiary.
      The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on
  GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the
  company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to
  provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a
  classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative
  voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for
  minority shareholders to elect directors.
      General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its
  shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.
      GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the
  value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.
      Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire
  &lt;Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the
  offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the
  Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private
  for 1.66 billion dlrs.
      GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace
  as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its
  two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it
  failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign
  payments and political contributions.
      GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television

  were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denshin

      Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry
  wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the
  size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign
  investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.
      He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged

  Malaysia's state oil company Petronas

      Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last
  September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest
  cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.
      Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its
  10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.
      However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report
  that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an
  average 510,000 bpd in 1987.
      The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices
  at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit
  further production cutbacks, the sources said.
      Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl
  this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.
      Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to
  the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced
  Indonesian and Chinese crude output.
      The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as
  there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due
  to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.
      In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two
  to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month

6453,"WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES
  West German commercial banks are
  cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking
  sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the
  Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the
  usual interim period.
      A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting
  leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis
  by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>
  and Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank
  fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.
      The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to
  gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings
  banks.
      A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could
  reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to
  draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one
  economist at the German Banking Association said.
      But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially
  undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are
  parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest
  them at higher yields in the future, he said.
      He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more
  funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated
  securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money
  supply aggregate.
      The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5
  pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,
  unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the
  expanded target range of three to six pct.
      Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private
  customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are
  beginning to decline.

  common shares, or about 9.8 pct, of Gencorp Inc's &lt;GY>
  outstanding common stock.
      General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash
  tender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern,
  that is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs.
      Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making,
  aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares
  outstanding.
      The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of
  financing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions.
      In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A.
  William Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it
  was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to
  meet as soon as possible.
      In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed
  250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for 
  a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and
  a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
  a unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP>.
      A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was
  meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He
  said he was not sure the company had formally received notice
  of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts.
      He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or
  whether it would issue a statement later today.
      In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain
  Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the
  company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its
  tires and related products segment.
      The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General
  broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes
  over license renewals at several of its television stations.
  Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR
  in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles.
      General Partners officials were not immediately available.
      Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York
  Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE
  said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The
  shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.
      The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in
  equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from
  Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for
  which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours
  after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr
  credit line from Wells Fargo.
      Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the
  line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest,
  the partnership said.
      Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in

6471,"MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS
  &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its
  1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of
  depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> shares
  and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.
      Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's
  seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on
  its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some
  eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.
      He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal
  approaches about a takeover of the group but was not
  interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not
  elaborate.
      Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during
  the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc
  &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year.
      The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the
  affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused
  on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the
  Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price
  during the bid.
      Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of
  corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance
  director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness
  affair.
      Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,
  resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider
  information. He currently faces criminal charges.
      Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been ""one of the
  most traumatic in our history,"" but that clients and staff had
  been supportive.
      ""I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have
  the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.""
      Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits
  of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from
  corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.
      Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the
  performance of the group so far in 1987 was ""within reasonable
  touch of the budget.""
      Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new
  chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as
  interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a
  new chief executive within a few months.
      He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of
  562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but
  declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going
  on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.

  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
  action against Allegheny International Inc, the
  Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
      Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
  SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
  through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
      ""Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
  was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
  intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
  proceeding against the company,"" Allegheny said.
      ""The company is cooperating in the commission's
  investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
  of testimony of employes and others,"" Allegheny said.
      In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
  for information about company executive compensation and
  benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
  entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
      It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
  divestitures, the company's accounting system ""and other
  internal controls,"" Allegheny said.
     The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
      The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
  on its enforcement actions.
      The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
  became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
  that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
  failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
  statements.
      The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
  complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
  securities law violations involving numerous current and former
  Allegheny officers and directors.
      Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
  court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
  the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
  public shareholders at an unfair price.
      Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
  against all charges.
      The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
  believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
  and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.
      In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March
  13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.

  Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned
  subsidiary of Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell
  by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record
  221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous
  year.
      Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news
  conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this
  year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable
  whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.
      He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last
  year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified
  amount from 1985's record levels.
      Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from
  9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10
  billion this year.
      Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the
  parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi
  would ensure VW got a share of profits.
      Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free
  reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years
  VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.
      Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output
  caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on
  currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About
  alleged ""sudden acceleration"" of some of its Audi 5000 models.
      As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct
  to 59,800 last year.
      Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom
  out in 1987.
      Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.
      Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,
  but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180
  in 1985.
      Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the
  first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall
  market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the
  same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales
  fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide
  deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to
  57,000.
      Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to
  over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen
  compared with 1985's 392,000.
      Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to
  further new hiring of employees.
      At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record

  The Bank of England said it had lent one
  billion stg to the discount market for fourteen days at 10 pct.
      This brings the Banks total help today to some 1.34 billion
  stg and satisfies the estimated shortage in the system today
  which it had earlier estimated at 1.3 billion stg.
      The Bank's announcement this morning that it was willing to
  lend two-week money at 10 pct was interpreted by the market as
  a sanction for lower U.K. Base lending rates.
      The U.K. Clearing banks swiftly took this up, cutting their
  base rates by a half-point to 10 pct. At midday, the central
  bank lowered its money market dealing rates by the same amount.

6541,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY
  Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry
  plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of
  recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts
  and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.
      The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored
  rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the
  market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea
  through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.
      The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct
  more competitive than Japan's due to such factors.
      The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of
  current capacity within two years through mergers and
  regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month
  and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.
      They said from September a semi-government body will assure
  repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred
  through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another
  30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.
      Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied
  to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage
  built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.
      The commission has held several hearings with the industry
  and approval should be given this month, the sources said.
      A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a
  planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support
  should help Japanese yards recover their international
  competitiveness, they said.
      Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of
  building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a
  maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)
  in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.
      This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most
  yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.
      The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for
  1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to
  3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.
      The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to
  30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between
  1986 and 1989.
      Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,
  followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's
  Register of Shipping.
      However, falling orders and declining international
  competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in
  the industry, the sources said.
      Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding
  companies reported current deficits in the first half of the
  year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report
  current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.
      The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise
  productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also
  been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt
  years, the sources said.
      In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in
  fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The
  two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T>
  and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> --
  account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.
      ""World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out
  the recession as their technology is the best in the world,""
  said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.
      The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,
  has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,
  and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.

  Continental Illinois Corp said if the
  Brazilian debt moratorium remains in effect, it may place its

      This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mln
  dlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10
  mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full

  according to the annual report released at the briefing.
      In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing a
  declining level of foreign currency reserves, declared a
  moratorium on the payment of interest on the country's medium
  and long term debt obligations.
      Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to

  Finance and economy ministers of the

  after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at

      But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
  Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a
  resolution on a common currency exchange rate system.
      The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed
  Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that
  the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank
  governors for further discussion.
      He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed
  denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were
  asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance
  ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia.
      Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to
  discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new
  system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit
  conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year.
      The denominator approved by the governors has not been made
  public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the

6581,"CONT'L ILLINOIS &lt;CIL> SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM
  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a
  substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's
  annual report says.
      One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for
  bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and
  requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be
  restored to current earnings status, it said.
      As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal
  taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.
      Continental said it decided to deal with this change ""in
  its entirety"" in 1987.
      Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation
  rules, and although the impact will not be material in the
  short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that
  income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report
  said.
      The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by
  17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.
      Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8
  mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in
  1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it
  said.
      Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the
  use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental
  takes place, the report said.
      This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
  sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next
  two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.
      In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior
  convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in
  the form of common stock.

  The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender
  offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be
  enough to buy the company, analysts said.
      Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General
  Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of
  GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty
  surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to
  Gencorp broadcasting licenses.
      Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.
      ""The expectation is either there will be someone else or
  the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's
  cooperation,"" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton
  group.
      Analysts said there is concern about challenges to
  Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio
  stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,
  were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments
  and political contributions.
      ""I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,""
  said Baker of the offer.
      Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue
  might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time
  for any transaction.
      A source close to General Partners, however, said General
  Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission
  for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.
  The source said if approved, the authority would allow a
  transaction to be carried out.
      If it received the ""short-form"" approval, General Partners
  would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting
  properties until the licensing situation is resolved.
      General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and
  Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.
      Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as
  General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of
  the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell
  the stations.
      GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt
  Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.
  Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a
  group that challenged the station's license.
      GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in
  Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.
      General Partners said it intends to keep the company's
  plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and
  related products segment.
      Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
  that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as
  much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace
  business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion
  dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,
  including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per
  share, he said.
      The company, formerly known as General Tire
  and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be
  worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling
  business might also be worth several dollars per share, he
  said.
      Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who
  became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's
  Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,
  founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the
  years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.
      ""The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal
  with the non-strategic assets of the company,"" Rose said.
      Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but
  they declined to predict what steps the company might take.
  They said it would be possible the company might consider a
  leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.
      General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there
  was some concern about ""greenmail."" Greenmail is the payment at
  a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.
      ""I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing
  surprises me anymore,"" said Rose.
      GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained
  First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.

  Fleet Financial Group said
  that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to
  merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which
  would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company.
      Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder
  will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the
  number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously
  announced April one Fleet stock split.
       The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's
  currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are
  about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.
      Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
  1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
  interstate banking law takes effect.
      For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island
  based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
  dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.
  holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
  assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
       Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
  transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar
  earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
  cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
  for either company's stock holders, the company said.
      For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
  dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual
  distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
  dlrs a share.
      In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other
  an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
  shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the
  fully diluted shares outstanding.
      The transaction is subject to both regulatory and

6708,"CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS
  Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL>
  Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to
  reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six
  months.
      Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of
  interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is
  expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks
  are under way.
      ""I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,
  for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's
  debt,"" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.
      ""I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just
  how long the run is is anybody's guess,"" Swearingen said.
      Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium
  may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs
  and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.
      The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these
  loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the
  Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,
  Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an
  inquiry.
      Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net
  income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.
      Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for
  1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.
  Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing
  office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.
      In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a
  share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.
      The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and
  other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,
  during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the
  1984 restructuring agreement with the government.
      The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it
  is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,
  Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss
  rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.
      In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market
  rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.
      Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank
  would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it
  bought three small suburban banks.
      Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be
  taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large
  enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are
  prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.
      He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who
  will eventually own the firm because it still holds the
  equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.
      The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has
  said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The
  agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984
  bailout of the bank.
      Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the
  struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry
  executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he
  agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not
  comment on a successor.
      The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options
  clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its
  doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country
  doesn't need external sources of cash.

6716,"EC WARNS CONGRESS ON NEW TRADE BILL
  The European Community (EC) has
  warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade
  legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.
  trading partners.
      The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head
  of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,
  chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
      A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.
      Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed
  aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the
  GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.
      But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would
  require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action
  against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and
  would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade
  practices.
      Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit
  member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in
  trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.
      He said ""If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,
  then the United States would be in violation of its
  international legal obligations and on a collision course with
  its major trading partners.""
      Denman added that a president should have flexibility in
  enforcing trade laws, saying ""in the last resort, any
  administration must take its decision in light of the overall
  national interest.""
      Otherwise, he said, ""the risk would be counter-reaction by
  trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or
  enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against
  imports from the United States.""
      Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it
  reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for
  firms to file unfair trade practice claims.
      Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards
  for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.
      ""Changes in these standards must be agreed upon
  multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States
  alone on the world trading system,"" he said.
      House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state
  legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb
  imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two
  years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.
      There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the
  entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.

  Fairchild Semiconductor Corp
  president Donald Brooks said he intends to take a management
  buyout proposal to the company's parent at some point in the
  future and substantial funding is available for such a
  purchase.
      Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>.
      Brooks also told a press conference that if management is
  successful, it may later attempt to take the company public.
      ""I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur,
  and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the
  avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital,""
  Brooks said.
      Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an
  exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu
  Ltd if successful in its buyout bid.
      Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of
  Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government
  officials expressed opposition to the transaction.
      Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be
  in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout.
      He also said the transaction could be financed through a
  debt issue or conventional financing from investors.
      Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment
  proposals bought to them, but he added, ""the investors must be
  willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not
  just selling off assets.""
      Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct
  intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger.
      ""I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington
  and Fujitsu, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist,"" Brooks

  CPC International Inc said it expects

      ""We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per
  share and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well,""
  the company said in its 1986 annual report.
      In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share,
  on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142
  mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
  The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in
  January.
      A share buyback program started last year reduced the
  number of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from
  97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.
      The food and grocery products company also said it was the
  subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit,
  filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and New
  Jersey.
      The suits are related to the company's purchase of its
  shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block
  of the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7
  mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.
      The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an
  artificially inflated price, violating securities laws,
  breaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate

  Carolina Power and Light Co said
  its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the
  second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.
      The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about
  one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in
  1992.
      Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under
  review because of a decision by the North Carolina
  Environmental Management Commission that would have required
  the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing
  scrubbers.
      Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation
  since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers
  through the use of low-sulphur coal, and ""The addition of
  scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal
  air quality improvements.""
      The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost
  power from Duke Power Co &lt;DUK> for intermediate and peaking
  purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with
  scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later
  development of a generating unit.
      Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about
  877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  ""The
  higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would
  increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with
  scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year.""
      A company spokesman said the company has already spent
  about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been

  not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina
  Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings
  it will make late this year or early next year.

      Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2
  billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit
  acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw
  president Michael de Groote told analysts.
      Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,
  or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.
      De Groote also said the company expects ""excellent results""
  in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more
  specific.
      He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not
  include possible further acquisitions and said that the
  addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988
  through fiscal 1990.
      De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four
  quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The
  rest came from acquisitions, he said.
      Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,
  a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will
  not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.

  negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based
  chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and
  U.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.
      De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the
  proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the
  next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical
  waste business through GSX Corp.
      ""We feel it is a profitable business with good growth
  potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right
  management,"" de Groote said.
      Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.
  subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a
  200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.

  Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.
      The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8
  billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1
  billion dlrs.
      The total was still the second highest ever reported, but
  it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.
      The figures reflected a radical split in the health of
  banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.
      In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while
  one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.
      Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC
  said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles
  it planned to issue.
      ""I don't remember a time when there was such a clear
  distinction by geographic area,"" FDIC Chairman William Seidman
  told reporters.
      He said that while the figures were not good, they showed
  the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but
  with regional differences in economic performance.
      Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many
  as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted
  the pace would continue. 
      On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208
  billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the
  number of new problem banks in all regions except the
  Southwest, Seidman said.
      Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth
  quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a
  year ago.
      Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or
  more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC
  said.
      Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's
  moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.
      He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom
  to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be
  expected.
      But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant
  other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,
  Seidman said.

      The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity

      Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would
  be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port
  Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a
  petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.

6816,"LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87
  Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG
  [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a
  moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln
  schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard
  Wagner said.
      Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct
  rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to
  greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling
  interest rates.
      The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend
  to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital
  from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.
      Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: ""We will endeavour
  to maintain the higher dividend in 1987.""
      Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7
  billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign
  currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of
  balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.
      Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business
  chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is
  effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped
  some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.
      Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from
  the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said
  that it came close to one mln stg.
      On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct
  to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed
  8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.
      According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to
  lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.
  Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

  Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr
  acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has
  dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,
  largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company
  officials and analysts said.
      State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second
  largest overnight courier business just two months after
  another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the
  acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New
  Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>.
      But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by
  financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies
  and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out
  foreign owned courier operations.
      ""It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at
  the right time,"" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst
  Tony Hine commented.
      The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.
  companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off
  their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt
  Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.
      ""There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent
  selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being
  under siege or taking someone else over,"" he said.
      Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd
  as part of its previously announced program to sell off four
  operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco
  Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.
      The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,
  and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of
  debt by year-end, the company said.
      While company officials declined to disclose earnings and
  revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant
  position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a
  day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs
  a year.
      The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit
  formed an important part of a company restructuring program,
  adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>,
  acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would
  consider acquiring the whole company.
      Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company
  formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of
  Purolator's U.S. courier business.
      For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier
  business represents an ""excellent financial investment"" in a
  market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman
  Esther Szynkarsky said.
      The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in
  EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.
      It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said
  the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and
  the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.
      She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of
  seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline
  business.
      Gelco will continue to operate with current management,
  independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already
  operates its own air cargo business that includes a small
  door-to-door courier operation.
      ""They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing
  well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep
  it,"" Szynkarsky said.
      Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units
  will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery
  network, generating traffic for the former parent companies
  without them having to tie up capital in Canada.
      ""The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is
  incremental revenue,"" Hine said.
      ""It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in
  place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff
  through, the more money you make,"" he added.

  proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR>, ranked as the
  largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning
  of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.
      Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for
  Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring
  the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date
  for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July
  one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.
      The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that
  said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be
  consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate
  banking outside of New England come down. ""If we can consummate
  the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,""
  Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in
  the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other
  banking institution in the state.
      He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only
  permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be
  amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.
      If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,
  an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase
  provisions.
      The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New
  York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled
  up by the money center giants.
      Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet
  and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of
  interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain
  permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.
  Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.
      Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed
  merger as ""a partnership of two companies."" Both will continue
  to operate existing headquarters after the merger.
      Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one
  of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one
  split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the
  deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.
      That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based
  Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion
  &lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is
  worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.
      Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas
  Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion
  dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer
  deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC>
  and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs
  and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast
  valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.
      ""It's a merger of equals,"" said analyst John Rooney of
  Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at
  the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book
  value was 28.02 dlrs.
      Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his
  60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said
  Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his
  retirement then Murray could assume the top post.
      Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said
  Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986
  on the basis of the merger terms announced today.
      He noted that Fleet has a ""teriffic reputation"" after
  having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has
  established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an
  innovator in securitization of mortgages.
      The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion
  dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar
  operates in most of New York state but not in New York City.
      Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations
  that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would
  be combined.
      The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a
  ""lock-up"" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each
  granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued
  shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares
  outstanding.

6922,"VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES
  Financial analysts see little chance
  that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow
  ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.
      ""We got a little volatility Wednesday,"" said Staley
  Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. ""But for the
  moment we're still in a trading range.""
      Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the
  U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its
  sluggish state, the analysts said.
      ""It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can
  break out of its very low volatility,"" said Carroll McEntee and
  McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. ""It needs something, but it's
  not going to be news about the economy,"" he said.
      Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out
  of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has
  stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct
  monetary policy.
      But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the
  dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted
  eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.
      In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and
  monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn
  said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back
  into the marketplace.
      ""The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the
  beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,"" Quinn said.
      Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are
  large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese
  investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of
  Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond
  market, he said.
      ""We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring
  yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,"" compared to
  the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.
      In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not
  likely to move futures.
      The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding
  operation did little to move cash government securities prices
  late Wednesday after the close of futures.
      ""I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the
  trading range),"" Lacey said.

6926,"U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS
  A key House panel voted to greatly
  ease government controls on exports as several House committees
  moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws
  they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes.
      The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International
  Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the
  list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no
  longer considered important to U.S. military security.
      Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign
  competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S.
  companies could not sell abroad.
      The issue has been the subject of administration debate.
  The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions
  impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current
  controls should be retained but better administered.
      Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of
  a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies
  sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade
  practices.
      Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be
  woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a
  vote by the full House in late April.
      Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling
  interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp.,
  the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to
  expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S.
  companies.
      Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be
  damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.
      ""We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of
  our national security,"" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a
  New Jersey Democrat said.
      The subcommittee also called for the administration to
  consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive
  government procurement practices.
      The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that
  the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were
  treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on
  lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr
  Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they
  were not allowed to bid on its construction.
      At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the
  subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese
  product--digital audio recorders.
      Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means
  Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against
  foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S.
  telecommunications products.
       Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S.
  companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of
  counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and
  patent laws.

  &lt;General Partners>, controlled by

      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's
  aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it
  would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.

  GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications

  station licenses.
      It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying
  to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc
  &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt
  Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
      But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's
  headquarter in Akron, Ohio.
      General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's
  plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and
  related products.
      But it left open that it might make other changes in
  GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.
      Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender
  offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs
  under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A.
  and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs
  from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its
  affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.
      In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,
  which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners
  officials said they were ""confident of our ability to promptly
  obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer
  materials.""

  The U.S. Departments of Agriculture
  and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the
  increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels
  under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.
      Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House
  Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two
  departments are negotiating a ""memorandum of understanding"" on
  cargo preference.
      Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food
  aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually
  increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost
  of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation
  Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said
  Transportation has so far contributed no money.
      The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected
  to resolve the matter, USDA officials said.
      Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural
  Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid
  shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to
  meet.
      ""As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,
  its going to be harder and harder to meet,"" Kay said.
      Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn
  English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export
  programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.
      In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference
  have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who
  view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.

6996,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY
  Higher world oil prices, coupled with a
  new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's
  economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget
  deficits, bankers and diplomats said.
      The months ahead will prove critical as the government
  attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices
  and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private
  sector.
      Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to
  about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could
  grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.
      But the economists said this will be possible only if the
  Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds
  in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced
  to curtail output for too long.
      Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend
  OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.
      Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at
  about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi
  Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.
      King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's
  new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western
  diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a
  stable source of income for its economy.
      Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a
  hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining
  revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross
  domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.
      Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10
  dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion
  dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.
      ""Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not
  be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can
  afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst
  effects,"" a diplomat said.
      In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of
  lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on
  foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.
      But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers
  and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in
  the longer term.
      It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a
  time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise
  to take over the lead role in the economy.
      Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of
  the risks attached to this policy but is determined to ""tough it
  out"" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion
  of reserves.
      The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion
  riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly
  recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign
  borrowing has been ruled out.
      Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi
  businessmen this week the government had carefully considered
  the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget
  plans late last year.
      ""It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50
  billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the
  economy,"" he said.
      Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early
  1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and
  tales of high spending became legendary.
      The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the
  fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management
  had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.
      Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,
  markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut
  back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.
      The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but
  Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate
  sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.
      Government moves to encourage lending and investigate
  company complaints about late public sector contract payments
  could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's
  industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.
      Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and
  more cash being placed on deposit.
      As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic
  development from the public to the private sector, one of the
  biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel
  personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom
  and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

7001,"FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS
  Media group John Fairfax Ltd &lt;FFXA.S>
  said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the
  impact of changes in the Australian tax system.
      Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to
  25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln
  a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30
  mln from 44.29 mln.
      Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in
  company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on
  fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the
  company said in a statement.
      Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue
  growth in the television industry as another reason for the
  flat first half earnings.
      It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of
  these factors.
      Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning
  Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as
  did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely
  satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.
      But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0
  pct rise in revenue, it said.
      Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net
  earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the
  receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from &lt;Australian
  Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's ""B""
  shares in Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L>.
      This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.
      Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the
  full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr
  acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne
  will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in
  Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

  The Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further
  slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its
  semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.
      The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the
  semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price
  Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to
  take retaliatory action after April 1.
      The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling
  cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of
  American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.
      MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been
  pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will
  boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.
      Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to
  reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,
  they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks
  of the first quarter.
      If that reduced production level were maintained through to
  the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct
  below that of the first three months of the year.
      MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the
  ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second
  quarter cutback.
      One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in
  Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there
  are picking up.
      MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese
  semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts
  to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.

704,"NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE
  The New York Mercantile Exchange set
  April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
  complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
       On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not
  hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
  a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
  market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
      ""This will change the way oil is transacted in the real
  world,"" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
      Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX
  prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
  differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.
       The expanded program ""will serve the industry because the
  oil market does not close when NYMEX does,"" said Frank Capozza,
  secretary of Century Resources Inc.
       The rule change, which has already taken effect for
  platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open
  interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to
  traders and analysts.
      Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
  an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position
  before entering into the transaction.
      Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
  futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both
  parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
  contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
      When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,
  NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, ""Expansion of the EFP
  provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
  providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.""

  Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct
  drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that,
  in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut
  its payout to 33 francs per share from 38.
      President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the
  first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would
  at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on
  outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.
      The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on
  Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of
  27 mln francs the previous year, he said.
      The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68
  mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs
  in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20
  mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on
  the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.
      Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276
  mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.
      Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln
  francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45
  mln francs supplementary depreciation.
      Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made
  this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate
  fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.
      While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in
  the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel
  prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc
  against other European currencies.
      ""Income and profit generated by services to these countries
  shrank by a very substantial margin,"" he said. ""Exchange rate
  trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other

  Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F>
  said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were ""satisfactory""
  despite burdens caused by the dollar's weakness against the
  mark and stagnating domestic demand.
      In its semi-annual shareholders' report, Porsche said first
  half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83
  billion in the same period of 1985/86.
      However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without
  giving absolute figures.
      Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380
  mln.
      Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45
  billion in the first half of last year, although the export
  quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct.
      The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of
  turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said.
      Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381.
  Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122
  from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut
  by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further,
  the report said.
      Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the
  comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued
  for all models but demand fell in other markets.
      Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397,
  while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share
  of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct.
      Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln.
      Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of
  the dollar and currencies in other important markets.
      Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11
  year at a ""high level,"" Porsche said.

  Deutsche Babcock AG
  &lt;DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year
  ending September 9 although the earnings level is still
  unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said.
      He told a news conference that business during the year had
  weakened somewhat but was still generally positive.
      Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26
  billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period.
  However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately
  unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when
  current orders from major projects are booked.
      Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end-
  February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion
  for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct
  increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks.
      Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at
  8.64 billion marks.
      Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct
  yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits
  totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the
  previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks.
      Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.
      Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the
  current business year, with financial reserves in the first
  five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing
  by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86.
      He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according
  to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and
  earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10.

  three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference
  shares.

      R. Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986

  increase in bad debt reserves.
      Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986.
  Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve
  financial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which
  were not adequate at the time of acquisition.
      He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will
  depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second

      Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.
  after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.
      Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,
  the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric
  against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their
  currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.
      The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized
  countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the
  currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main
  focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to
  close the competiveness gap for American goods.
      U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he
  expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.
      But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their
  own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not
  risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries
  of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and
  Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.
      ""In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was
  Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,"" said Robert Chandross, of
  Lloyds Bank PLC.
      Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore
  and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170
  billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.
      The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in
  1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade
  deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.
      And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is
  continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6
  billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The
  gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.
      Lately both nations have said they will take steps to
  defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many
  of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import
  tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.
      Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last
  week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to
  five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.
      For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut
  tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and
  try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang
  Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect
  Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.
      The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles
  and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the
  area of ""big-ticket"" manufactured goods, notably cars.
      Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America
  -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.
      ""The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When
  their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing
  base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,"" said Bob
  Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.
      The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,
  72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its
  telecommunications equipment.
      A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and
  South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.
      While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the
  U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.
      But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in
  marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into
  large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade
  and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.
      Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to
  18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and
  Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.
      Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.
      ""A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been
  at Japan's expense,"" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.
      February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers
  exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.
      But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response
  from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work
  with a sizeable lag, economists say.
      The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and
  Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is
  pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since
  September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.
      But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against
  the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.
      ""We've not seen any lessening of competition from those
  countries that we can attribute to currency changes,"" said
  Bethlehem Steel's Wendt.
      And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their
  hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.
      Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will
  get given the administration's free-trade stance. ""It's hard to
  see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then
  the question is, will it have teeth?"" one economist said.

714,"TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA>
  A bidding war for Viacom International
  Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
  management group and other investors against National
  Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
      Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
  close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
  side. He said if outside directors approve the management
  proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
  with proxy material going out late this week. ""It would take 20
  days from the day we mail,"" said the source.
      The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
  investor Sumner Redstone, would need ""half a year"" to complete
  a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
  accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
  and cable television franchises.
      Redstone was not available for comment.
      Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
  situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
  said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
  if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
  the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
      The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
  meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
      Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
  major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. ""We think
  we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,"" said the firm's
  arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
      Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
  create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
  management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
  billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
  stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
      Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
  a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
  value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
  stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
  interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
  the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
  total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
      Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
  preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
  convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
  was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
      Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
  would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
  April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
  plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
  during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
  eight pct interest.
      Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
  group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
  were offering high prices. ""Redstone really wants to own the
  company,"" one said. Another said management seemed to have the
  edge on the timing issue.
      Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
      A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
  the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
  noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which
  adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
  traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
  just over 30 dlrs.
      Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
  two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
  from several acquisitions affected results.
      Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to
  31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
  mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
  37.50 dlrs.
      Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
  rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
      Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>.
  The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
  nine satellite television services and owns television and

      -- Revising the definition of ""infested"" to give equal value
  to all insects injurious to grain.

  Pillsbury Corp, reporting lower
  earnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strong
  performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group
  declines.
      Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operating
  profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales
  rose four pct.
      It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher
  operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale,
  which introduced a new menu.
      Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger
  King's distribution arm, and said increased investment spending
  on developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill
  - hurt results.
      It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items,
  rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads
  and baking products major contributors to improvement in the
  quarter.
      A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in
  profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.
      Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr
  profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the
  sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and
  lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early
  retirement program initiated a year ago.
      Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5
  mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 cts
  a share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from
  1.46 billion dlrs.
      Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the
  1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per-share earnings by nine
  cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months.
      As a result of the act, it said its effective income tax
  rate rose eight points to 48.1 pct in the quarter and 5.5
  percentage points to 49.7 pct for the nine months.

718,"TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE, GROUP SAYS
  Canada's decision to raise the issue
  of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see
  as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy
  study group said 
      ""It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,
  when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar
  world,"" the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.
      U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer
  aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,
  the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments
  of about 150 billion dlrs annually.
      The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline
  of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in
  U.S.-Canadian relations.
     The study said liberalized trade between the two countries
  would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world
  markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.
      The council said ""in the past most Canadians have shied away
  from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be
  overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer
  association with a country 10 times their size in population.""
      But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their
  domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and
  sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an
  increasingly competitive world.
      The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly
  interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against 
  allegedly subsidized exports.
      A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed
  on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being
  subsidized.
      The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending
  curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and
  the so-called ""cultural industries"" - publishing, broadcasting
  and films.
      It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense
  cooperation, ""acid rain"" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian
  assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.

  Panama Canal toll charges will not rise
  in the year to end-September 1988, despite last October's

  waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said.
      He told a press conference that in confirming the
  Commission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,
  he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.
      The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in
  the current financial year but this could be carried over and
  met from next year's revenues.
      This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost
  the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included
  eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being
  spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further
  landslides.
      He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and
  he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any
  threat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.
      Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard
  cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding

  Solar Systems by Sundance Inc said it

      It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains an
  ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of
  AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German
  publication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was
  about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the
  condoms made by INKEY.
      The company also said it is changing its name to
  Eurocapital Corp shortly.
      Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a
  U.S.-based &lt;Europharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate own
  the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to
  distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are
  being developed by INKEY.
      The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for
  the distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30
  days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug
  Administration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file
  with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval
  process to be a lengthy one.
      The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is
  currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated
  to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been
  tested in a spermicide.
      Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand
  name, ""Carlton."" The exclusive distribution contract for the
  products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year
  periods, the company said.
      It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have
  not gone on sale in other European countries.
      It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the
  resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement
  or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from
  the FDA.
      The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to
  acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little

7310,"GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING
  The Association of German Cooperative
  Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates
  would continue to remain low for the time being.
      It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong
  foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in
  the economy that could affect the long-term capital market.
      The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for
  higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation
  late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in
  nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.
      The association said generally low interest rates,
  prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected
  strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment
  climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue
  its slow but very sure growth.
      The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest
  rates down on the short-term money market although its policies
  had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,
  which was so important for investment financing and thus for
  the course of the economy, it said.
      In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy
  had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the
  association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy
  through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.
      On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking
  dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.
      The association said time would show to what extent
  speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic
  money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank
  could hold down money market rates with the highly effective
  instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.

7355,"UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS
  The ""cross field allowance"" relief on
  Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT
  paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.
      The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of
  qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of
  other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments
  outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.
      A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not
  paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly
  benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.
      ""The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators
  in those fields which have no PRT liability,"" the report said,
  adding that the timing of development of such fields may be
  advanced.
      The government would in effect be subsidising these
  developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before
  corporation tax, the report said.
      On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is
  of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will
  be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will
  rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.
      In a study on probable fields, the report said that when
  the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying
  field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the
  U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a
  small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9
  pct.
      The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will
  be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only
  will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's
  future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will
  be lost.
      Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts
  will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later
  time.

7366,"TEXAS COMMERCE &lt;TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987
  Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that
  relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with
  Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase
  from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.
      Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with
  Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected
  earnings to increase.
      ""We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement
  over last because we are stronger,"" Love said, referring to
  Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.
  The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will
  lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15
  basis points, Love said.
      The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition
  by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved
  interstate banking effective January 1.
      Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas'
  struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report
  profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which
  earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN> lost 17.6
  mln dlrs, MCorp &lt;M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5
  mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation &lt;FBT>, which is actively
  seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln
  dlrs.
      Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its
  energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's
  nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.
      ""I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,"" he
  said. ""The fact that the real estate market is still moving
  away suggests there could be some continuing growth of
  nonperforming loans.""
      In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses
  related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy
  loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the
  bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43
  pct.
      More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans,
  which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln
  dlrs the year before, were in real estate.
      Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for
  Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the
  third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office
  buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about
  30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four
  years, he said.
      ""I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil
  at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a
  barrel,"" he said.
      Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate
  subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its
  holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to
  build up its consumer banking business, Love said. ""We are
  resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,""
  he said.
      In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in
  Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,
  and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas
  Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the
  Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member
  banks, he said.
      One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced
  in December, InterFirst Corp &lt;IFC> and RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT>,
  both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued
  at 570 mln dlrs.
      The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and
  InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas
  banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion
  plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. ""We think
  we can try to get a little part of their roost,"" he said.
      The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an
  edge in developing new consumer products, he said.
      ""We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than
  one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us
  how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,"" he
  said, referring to expansion of such existing products as
  credit cards and investment banking.

  stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a
  prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,
  analysts said.
      American Express earlier said it has a general
  understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a
  13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.
      The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,
  as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment
  in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.
      The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to
  the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.
  firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a
  price of 2.7 times book value.
      Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,
  depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider
  trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8
  times book value.
      American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For
  the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of
  a spinoff of part of Shearson.
      Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will
  benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly
  important Tokyo financial markets.
      ""I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,"" said
  Long.
      ""What you will see probably in the future is American
  Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and
  have a public vehicle for Shearson,"" Long said.
      ""Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment
  into an illiquid situation,"" he said of Nippon.
      Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in
  Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like
  other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.
      American express has said the total employees of shearson
  will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that
  number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company
  spokesman said.
      American Express officials would not comment beyond a
  statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not
  close off the possibility of a public offering or other option
  for Shearson.
      David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible
  Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes
  the firm will digest the Nippon investment first.
      ""I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with
  the money they have,"" he said.
      Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said
  American Express could determine to sell shares to the public.
      In its statement, the financial services giant said it is
  continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to
  the investment by Nippon.
      American Express said options under study range from
  expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition
  to broadening its access to capital.
      American Express also said the options reflect the
  continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'
  worldwide financial services strategy.
      Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a
  Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to
  Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.
      Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.
      ""Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They
  don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital
  growth,"" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other
  U.S. brokerage companies.
      Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are
  interested in the expertise of American brokers. ""Those
  (Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have
  the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the
  money. That's a nice marriage,"" he said.
      Morgan Stanley and Co &lt;MS> rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8. First
  Boston Corp &lt;FBC> was up one to 51-1/4. E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH>
  rose 1-1/4 to 41-1/8, and PaineWebber Group &lt;PWJ> climbed 7/8

  Liberalization of Italy's foreign exchange
  controls should be ""gradual"" but also ""reasonably rapid,"" a report
  issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury
  Ministry said.
     The report, looking at the country's financial development
  prospects, said Italy's large public sector deficit and growing
  public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual
  liberalization preferable.
      The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pct
  oscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during
  the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term
  domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from
  portfolio adjustments.
      The lira's fluctuation margin is currently significantly
  higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies.
      Italy has over recent months announced a series of
  deregulation moves in response to a European Community
  directive aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods,
  services and finance by 1992.

  Caisse de depot et placement du
  Quebec, the government agency which manages the province's
  pension funds, said its investment portfolio earned a net
  profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, an
  increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985.
      The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets
  with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value
  of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986.
      These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the
  year, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct in
  the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years.
      The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6
  pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted
  for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio.
      The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yielded
  a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than
  either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the
  13.5 pct for all funds under management.
      ""These high liquidity securities, which are held on a
  temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection
  of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient,"" the agency
  said of the U.S. securities.
      The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in

  dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.

  compared with 1986, when it earned 2.53 billion Swedish crowns,
  or 371.1 mln dlrs.
      A company spokesman said 1986 results were boosted
  significantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclear
  power plants.
      This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return to
  profitability by Asea's power transmission segment, which had a
  loss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.
      Currency conversions were made at 6.81 crowns to the dlr.
      The spokesman said the company has built up a strong
  backlog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 and
  beyond.
      At yearend 1986, Asea's order backlog stood at 32.7 billion
  crowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5
  billion dlrs, at the end of 1985.

  Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC
  Delegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislation
  is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficit
  and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.
      ""To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by
  legislation is a mistake,"" he told the Foreign Trade
  Association here.
      Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he
  warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee
  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a
  product-for-product basis.
      ""Retaliation does not have to be matched product to
  product,"" Denman said.
      He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,
  however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.
      ""Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European
  exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely
  to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to
  Europe,"" Denman said.
      He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require
  countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to
  cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.
      ""This would conflict with international obligations, throw
  a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and
  could easily boomerang,"" he warned of the tariff proposals.
      Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek
  reciprocity in specific trade sectors.
      ""Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers
  would simply lead to retaliation from the other party,"" he
  said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by
  trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in
  another.

748,"PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI &lt;AMI> BID
  Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he
  has had discussions with several American Medical International
  Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the
  company.
      Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr
  takeover bid for American Medical with several large
  shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family
  of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support
  one way or the other for his offer, he said.
      Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the
  conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage
  whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is
  support for his offer.
      Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held
  discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,
  the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical
  stock.
      Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, 
  said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical
  management and other American Medical shareholders.
      Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American
  Medical and its business would be ""highly desirable and
  appropriate at this time.""
      ""That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of
  shareholders of AMI really share,"" said Pesch.
      Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his
  takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four
  dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each
  American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in
  an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not
  rule out a future takeover try.
      Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal
  with the Bass family.
      Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's
  takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some
  shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's
  previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from
  Pesch.
      American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.
  Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a
  management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.
      An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment
  on the new Pesch offer by March 10.
      Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in
  the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.
      The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American
  Medical, and the company has previously said the investors
  support management's internal plan to improve the company's
  performance. The Bass family would not comment on American
  Medical or Pesch.
      Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp
  last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall
  Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic
  acquisition.
      Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall
  street questioning whether financing can be completed for the
  much larger American Medical takeover proposal.
      Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without
  an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall
  Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with
  representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities
  and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.
      ""I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be
  worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where
  Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly
  environment,"" Pesch said.
      Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing
  arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in
  acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American
  Medical management in place.
      He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to
  form an efficient network of hospitals.
      Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could
  be made for American Medical.
      Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second
  fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth
  about 20 dlrs per share.
      Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second
  quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct
  loss last year.
      Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more
  than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.
      But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction
  could be completed because of the revised structure of the
  offer. ""I think it's much more doable,"" he said.
      Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround
  by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.

  A U.S. Navy battle group led by the
  U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is in the northern Arabian Sea
  amid renewed concern about the safety of shipping off the coast
  of Iran, U.S. officials said today.
      But Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffmann said that reports the
  naval strike force was in the region did not mean the United
  States was sending a new warning to Iran against escalating
  attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.
      ""Nothing like that has happened,"" he said. ""No signal is being

      He said that the Kitty Hawk is operating in an area where
  it usually does. ""It's normal. It's in the waters where it's
  supposed to be. It's been there for over a month.""
      The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstay
  of the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast area
  extending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.
      With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to the
  south and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf to
  the north, the United States has 10 warships on either end of
  the strategic Straits of Hormuz.

      State Department officials cited concern about the safety
  of ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supply
  run to the Gulf.

  A top Swiss banker called for an
  obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and
  said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company
  should be made to declare their share.
      In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG>,
  chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'
  own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,
  to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.
      A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss
  franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to
  prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.
      Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the
  market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were
  readily available to professionals through specialised
  information systems.
      ""We should make this classification obligatory and publish
  it in places that are easily accessible to lay people,"" he said.
  The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these
  ratings should also be continually updated, he said.
      Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,
  worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares
  and participation certificates rather than bearer shares.
      However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The
  recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> to take over Hero
  Conserven Lenzburg &lt;HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961
  pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone
  who was not eligible according to the company's statutes.
      Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not
  carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of
  greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.

      The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far,
  and they said Japan would comment on the final results.
      A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study
  has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in
  the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other
  commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been

  OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting
  in mid-May.
      One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was
  based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped
  sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,
  and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.
      ""The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does
  not take account of various differences in farming conditions
  in each country, such as geography,"" the source said.
      He said it is highly likely that the final study will show
  Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.

  market further, but this would have little impact on Japan's

  would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.
      Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements
  signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause
  stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC
  negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: ""We wanted
  the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no.""
      A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was
  made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be
  necessary to complete the work.
      Any decision in principle to set up relations would require
  approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the
  executive committee of Comecon.
      Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the
  East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: ""We
  have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not
  on all questions.""
      Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any
  joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the
  Community, he replied: ""This question is not contained in the
  draft which our side presented.""
      West German diplomats said they would insist on including
  the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.
      The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading
  blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks
  between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic
  relations in January.
      The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite
  non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five
  billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half
  the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of
  Soviet oil imported by the EC.

  Ohio Edison Co said it has
  completed the sale and leaseback of 30 pct of its 30 pct
  interest in Unit One of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant,
  receiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest.
      The utility said the share of its interest in the 1,205
  megawatt generating plant was sold to a group of institutional
  investors which leased it back to the company for a period of
  about 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate.
      Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance the
  rest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans
  incurred for the retirement of high-interest long-term debt.
      Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments, but it said
  the ""payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company
  will need to cover our investment in Perry, which translates
  into savings for our customers.""
      The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the
  amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It plans
  on filing a rate application with the Public Utilities
  Commission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year.
      It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to the
  investors because they could take quicker advantage of tax
  benefits than the utility could.

  Several analysts said they do not

  Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management
  group from Purolator's courier division.
      There had been speculation another offer might be
  forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share
  price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
  is fully valued.
      Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
  another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
  for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
      Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
  had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
  Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
  might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
      analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
  offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
  sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
      Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
  Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
      Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
  shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
  29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
  a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.

  The Bank of Finland said it has

      Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news
  conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money
  market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit
  amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.
      ""The recent introduction of three-month money and these new
  regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market
  and the discount rate as monetary instruments,"" Kullberg said.
      Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these
  were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank
  of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs,
  they said.
      ""The central bank for the first time has an instrument with
  which it really can influence the price of money in this
  country,"" one banker said.
      Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits
  to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital
  and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now
  introduced if the limit is exceeded.

  department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy
  on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.
      ""We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the
  first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we
  will issue at least a few times a week,"" Korkman told Reuters.
      He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a
  three-month maturity at first as the market was best developed
  for paper of that maturity.
      The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month
  credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank
  and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional
  overnight call money market.
      Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around
  nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week,
  while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion.
      On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade

  Companies will henceforth be able to own
  stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a ""dominant""
  holding, an Italian government committee ruled.
      The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,
  headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision
  reflected the ""need to safeguard the principle of separation
  between banks and non-financial concerns.""
      It did not quantify what might constitute a ""dominant""
  holding.
      The committee also set conditions for the allocation of
  credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in
  them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy
  could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held
  by banks in companies or other banks.
      Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their
  subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more
  of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.
      The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth
  of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or
  two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the
  group or individual concerned.
      Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns
  in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign
  banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to
  subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be
  excluded from the conditions.
      The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in
  their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding
  five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged
  treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.
      With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of
  Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a
  bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a
  company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or
  indirectly.
      Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held
  is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.
      The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value
  of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two
  predefined limits.
      These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the
  total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.

  Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> is
  resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications
  firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a
  change in those plans, a company executive said.
      Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of
  the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share
  to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy
  Jonathan Solomon told reporters.
      That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful
  business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the
  Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of
  protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign
  firms from a meaningful position in the market.
      Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> of the United States also
  holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,
  &lt;International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC).
      Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret
  Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have
  written to the Japanese government about the planned merger.
      A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
  Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also
  expressed opposition to the merger, he said.
      The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again
  that it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai Denshin
  Denwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international calls
  from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign
  shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.
      In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met
  Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange
  the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.
      At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre
  optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its
  global network.
      ""C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as
  application and other procedures,"" said Watanabe, who is also
  chairman of &lt;Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>. The Japanese
  side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left
  with the new firm, after the merger.
      ""These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration
  of Japan's economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we
  are not a colony or something,"" said Watanabe.

7771," EC SAYS U.S. BROKE TRADE RULES IN AKZO-DUPONT ROW
  The European Community Commission has
  charged the United States with breaking international trade
  rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and
  said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.
      In the latest of a series of trade disputes with
  Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of
  the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated
  against imported products in favour of domestically-produced
  goods.
      The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule
  on whether the section in question, which officials said had
  proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.
      Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures
  if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to
  bring the disputed section into line with international rules.
      The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint
  to it by the Dutch company Akzo &lt;AKZO.AS>, whose ""aramid""
  synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because
  of charges by the U.S. Firm &lt;Dupont> that the fibres violate
  the American company's patents.
      Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.
  International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and
  incompatible with GATT provisions.
      The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the
  U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported
  products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not
  have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the
  ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.
      ""Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable
  than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods
  produced in the United States,"" it said in a statement.

      The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S.
  Complaint, starting with informal consultations and then
  holding a special session in July, trade officials said.
      ""The tension has eased,"" the permanent trade ambassador of
  the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters.
  ""The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels.""
      U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what
  they call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during a
  visit to European capitals in February.
      In a letter calling for the special committee meeting,
  Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain and
  the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.
      The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules
  laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.
      Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to
  purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines
  during the special session and asked the committee to confirm
  its view.
      Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views
  would be considered during the informal consultations but the
  Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against
  American civil aircraft practices.
      Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such
  broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil
  aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters would
  be considered during the informal meetings.

  show significant improvement over 1986.""
      American Can earned 196.3 mln dlrs, or 3.21 dlrs per share,

      In the 1987 first quarter, American Can will record a
  one-time gain of 28 cts per share from the sale of shares in
  its Musicland Group subsidiary. The gain is slightly higher
  than the expected gain the company predicted in February
  because additional shares of the unit were sold.
      In response to a question, Tsai said American Can's

  According to press reports, American Can owns 20 pct of

  reporters' queries.
      ""You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons
  in the second half,"" Holden-Brown said following a presentation
  to Toronto securities analysts.
      Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in
  profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in
  the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln
  stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.
      Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost
  of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs
  associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the
  company, Holden-Brown also said.
      But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary
  gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct
  interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.
      ""So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But
  hopefully you win them all in the end,"" Holden-Brown said.
      Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other
  take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: ""No, I don't.""
      ""We must never be complacent and we must always be very
  watchful, but I think we would be very expensive,"" he said.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate
  earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies
  in the food and beverage industry.
      ""That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had
  come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I
  think,"" Holden-Brown said.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram
  Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders
  take-over bid for the company was ""100 pct a growth action.""
      ""We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and
  that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was)
  defensive, but it never was,"" Holden-Brown told reporters.
      Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share
  issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram
  Walker, Holden-Brown responded: ""Plan might be too strong a

  Trade is the most urgent problem
  facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to
  reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark,
  Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.
      Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for
  more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.
      ""The most urgent problem now is the trade question because
  that has to be decided within the next 10 months,"" Clark told
  the Commonwealth Club of California. ""We have a fast track
  authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of
  whatever the negotiators achieve.""
      Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial
  agreement must be reached by late September or early October.
      He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain,
  and defense as the second and third most important bilateral
  issues facing Ottawa and Washington.
      On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek
  2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain
  problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in
  advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with
  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
      In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs
  group, Clark said that the two countries must find better
  mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.
      ""This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on
  corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were
  quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place
  now are not working adequately in either of our interests,"" he
  said.
      Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's rules
  on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he
  said.
      ""There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to
  secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to
  move their head offices out of our country into your country
  because you have national procurement requirements,"" he said.
      In turn, he added, the United States would like to change
  some of the procurement requirements that exist at the
  provincial government level in Canada.
      Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.
      ""What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in
  the first instance, to propose, and then governments and
  congresses will have judge,"" he said.
      In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States
  has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to
  its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan.
  ""Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year
  than you bought from Canada,"" he said. REUTER

8044,"U.S. SENATORS SAY SANCTIONS LIKELY ON MICROCHIPS
  The United States will likely impose
  sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said
  today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm
  Baldrige.
      Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision
  would be taken until a final determination is made on whether
  Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said
  they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.
      President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which
  Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.
      ""I am confident we will see action taken,"" Sen. John McCain,
  an Arizona Republican, told reporters.
      ""I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than
  sanctions,"" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.
      The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor
  industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department
  officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September
  1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United
  States and other countries.
      They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through
  tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for
  continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100
  mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.
      Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.
  Pete Wilson told reporters, ""The clear import of what he said is
  that there will be.""
      ""Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions
  must be applied,"" for past violations of the agreement, the
  California Republican said.
      The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips
  which are used in high technology products ranging from radios
  to defence missile guidance systems.
      Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told
  them the administration had not made a final determination that
  Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below
  the cost of production in the United States or other countries.
      But McClure said senators told him, ""There is no doubt
  dumping is going on,"" based on evidence such as invoices of
  purchases of the Japanese products.
      The two countries signed a pact last September in which
  Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United
  States and other countries below production costs and to allow
  the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.
      In return, the United States waived its right to impose
  import duties on the Japanese microchips.
      Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact
  and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to
  save the pact.
      Japan has frequently been the target of congressional
  discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade
  deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United
  States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.
      The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution
  calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact
  since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House
  next week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.

8069,"WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA
  World Bank President Barber Conable is
  expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest
  debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to
  tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.
      Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will
  meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.
      He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's
  largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world
  oil prices called for major policy adjustments.
      Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects
  in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous
  island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed
  discussions with ministers tomorrow.
      Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely
  hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and
  gas revenues in half.
      Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to
  provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia
  pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.
      Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to
  the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31
  pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to
  bridge its deficit.
      Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto
  and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy
  change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
  protected economy.
      ""Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call
  for major policy adjustments and external support,"" Conable said
  in his arrival statement.
      But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next
  month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that
  the Bank is demanding specific changes.
      ""We believe there has been wise leadership here and the
  economy is being very well managed,"" Conable told reporters at
  Jakarta airport.
      Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling
  37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the
  Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7
  billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.
      Conable did not spell out what further changes he would
  like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes
  already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.
      Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,
  the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the
  government's trade reform measures, and supported its
  determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.
      Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last
  May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage
  outside investment.
      Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look
  into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be
  sold.
      But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the
  government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.
      Western analysts say that in particular the government is
  unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
  monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.
      Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that
  Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.
      It could not spend its way out of trouble because this
  would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic
  inflation.
       He said the main objective was to raise exports outside
  the oil and natural gas sector.
      Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the
  government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial
  year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in
  1986/87.

8074,"NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA
  Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the
  rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts
  see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has
  depreciated steadily.
      The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks
  bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they
  offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest
  successful bid made at the auction.
      This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure
  that they were successful while paying the lower ""marginal"" rate,
  analysts said.
      ""It should act as a brake because banks will know that if
  they bid high they will have to pay what they offered,"" a
  Western diplomat commented.
      The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct
  since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange
  Market (SFEM), began last September 26.
      At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at
  4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row.
      ""They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of
  trying to stop the trend,"" the diplomat said.
      The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be
  fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.
      It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's
  scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was
  planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer
  at each auction.
      Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped
  supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further
  weakening the naira.
      If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the
  fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective
  of the new system, analysts said.
      Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the
  official exchange rate for the naira applying to business
  transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the
  lowest successful bid.
      SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment
  program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic
  recovery plan in Black Africa.
      The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for
  the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising
  imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing
  inefficient government participation in the economy.
      The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing
  this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often
  sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living
  standards.
      Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria,
  said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment
  program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions.
      ""So far so good"" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos,
  adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite
  would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit.
      Fears that the program would encourage inflation were
  incorrect, he said.
      Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban
  prices had already reflected the naira's black market value
  before the currency was allowed to find its true level last
  September.

  Ministers from more than 20
  nations were told by New Zealand that the next international
  negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this
  century and the cost of failure could not be measured.
      Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a
  welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great
  progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which
  must not be sidetracked.
      ""We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world
  trading system,"" he said.
      ""We have seen that the failure of the world trading system
  has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our
  failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us
  all,"" Moore said.
      He added: ""The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is
  our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not
  get another chance before the year 2000.""
      The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade
  since the ""Uruguay round"" talks last Sepember. The meeting is
  also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in
  June.
      The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have
  been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere
  countries managing to have service industries such as banking
  and insurance included in the next full round.
      The southerners' goal of including agricultural and
  tropical products also was met.
      The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is
  described by participants as informal and no declaration is
  expected.
      Moore said one aim was to ""instil a sense of political
  urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.""
      Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to
  people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the
  benefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontation
  while we proceed with orderly negotiations.""
      The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations
  including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.
      The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter.
      American sources say he is ready to state that the best way
  to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to
  implement four key Uruguay proposals:
      -- an end to agricultural subsidies;
      -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT
  regulations;
      -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called
  intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and
  copyrights;
      -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92
  member states.

  The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank
  said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's
  minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits
  from its operations in the country.
      Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply
  with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln
  dinars -- by the start of 1986.
      Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told
  Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher
  level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The
  bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.
      Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher
  capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided
  instead to close its operation, banking sources said.
      Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while
  the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.
      Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an
  exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply.
  They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between
  Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties.
      The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to
  550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars.

8098,"U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING
  A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury
  supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit
  market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it
  with some focus, economists said.
      ""Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to
  work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,""
  said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
      The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of
  two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block
  this week.
      The ""mini-refunding,"" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in
  new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for
  auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on
  Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on
  Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and
  six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.
      The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly
  auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting
  sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy
  U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in
  Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.
      Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared
  unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in
  high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.
  Equities.
      But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are
  signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a
  bit.
      ""Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,
  and there is a marked absence of selling,"" they said in a weekly
  report.
      Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes
  banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's
  sales.
      ""The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.
  Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these
  maturities has been wider, it is still positive,"" he said in a
  weekly market review.
      But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate
  enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the
  overseas markets have had their run.
      ""Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate
  that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,"" said economists
  at Salomon Brothers Inc.
      Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors
  are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the
  higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year
  on April 1.
      And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big
  buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.
  Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.
      Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian
  monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies
  should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond
  markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.
      Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the
  U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,
  economists said.
      This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with
  February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from
  January's depressed levels.
      Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said
  several areas, including transport equipment, should have
  bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap
  total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after
  January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain
  as large as five pct.
      Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to
  show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.
  Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the
  January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food
  prices declined.
      Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate
  will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the
  approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.
      Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this
  week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the
  new statement period beginning on Thursday.
      Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected
  to open near that level.

  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.

  made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last
  September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on

      European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq

  -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.
      Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters
  bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of
  the world was no way to solve trade disputes.
      New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues
  great progress had been made in preparing for the current round
  of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.
      The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum

  that they tended to get bogged down for years. ""Countries don't

      ""They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate
  solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are

  Iran said reports that it intended to

      Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign
  Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would
  be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the
  world.""
       U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks
  apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do
  whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face
  of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.
      The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been
  told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a
  threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.
      U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made
  anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to
  merchant ships than missiles used before.
      The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended
  to attack ships were ""misleading propaganda.""
      He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause
  of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""all
  its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.""
      Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""We
  are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping
  going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very

      ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what

  &lt;Dart Group Corp> said it told

  would pay to acquire the company.
      Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL
  share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.
      SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.
      In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was
  denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to
  other potential bidders.
      SGL officials could not be reached for comment.
      Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the
  sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,
  but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to
  SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key
  employees.
      ""We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout
  firms,"" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL
  management may be considering a leveraged buyout.
      Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a
  friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all
  the terms of its offer.
      Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not
  received any other offer.
      It said it requested the confidential information to better
  understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign
  an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without
  SGL's approval.
      The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy
  SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions
  unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly
  transaction, it said.
      Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.
      Dart said it requested the information before its meeting
  with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope
  representatives would reach an agreement.
      It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told
  there were certain issues important to SGL management and while
  they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take
  them into account in putting together its package.
      It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln
  dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice
  president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.
      Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'
  severance agreements, although there was an implication that
  Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their
  own volition.
      Dart said under their present agreements, none of these
  officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,
  Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6
  mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's
  incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost
  of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares
  unless waived by the company's compensation committee.
      Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top
  management's supplemental retirement plan.
      Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance
  obligations and future salary guarantees for top management,
  estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations
  under the company's present policy.
      Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to
  discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to
  negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.
      Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain
  and Rickels home centres.
      Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed
  by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such
  actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.
      The suit also sought to have directors carry out their
  fiduciary duty.
      Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an
  unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of
  securities to shareholders which make a takeover more
  expensive.

8117,"AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES
  The government's
  over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting
  Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum
  Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.
      Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is
  derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak
  crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.
      This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the
  country's economic performance directly by acting as a
  disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting
  trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.
      Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency
  position is posing a major economic threat, yet the
  government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the
  oil industry, Benbow said.
      Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to
  fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from
  546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the
  Bass Strait fields, he said.
      Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the
  three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.
      By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over
  half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped
  fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from
  existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.
      Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered
  fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.
      Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to
  680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a
  crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years
  time, he said.
      At present world oil prices and the current value of the
  Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost
  between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.
      Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the
  addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.
      For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five
  years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.
      He called on the government to review its tax policies to
  restore incentive to exploration.

      Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk

      It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere

      McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain
  about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.
      Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the
  Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the
  last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.
      He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming
  20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the
  rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.
      More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the
  Middle East, he said.
      McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil
  outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a
  diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic
  stability.
      ""It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country
  discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable
  taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of

  A 10 percentage

      A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait

      Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer
  appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.

  before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co

8137,"GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM 
  West German bond yields could decline
  over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize
  exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to
  keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.
      But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under
  agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.
      The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized
  currencies with the threat of central bank intervention,
  economists said.
      Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster
  the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates
  further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April.
  ""The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank
  and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate
  are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.
  and foreign interest rates,"" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent
  study.
      It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads
  was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will
  have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.
      West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged
  the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the
  Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid
  weakening the dollar.
      West German economists see room for further cuts in leading
  West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.
      ""It's not a taboo,"" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank
  AG said.
      But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates
  only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation
  will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.
      The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already
  nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50
  pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.
   Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to
  shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move
  would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and
  long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the
  Bundesbank lowered its discount rate.
      It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as
  the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow
  growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.
      But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West
  German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to
  meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may
  force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must
  be filled by higher government borrowing.
      This may not occur if private sector demand for credit
  remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.
      Economists said it appeared the government had already
  stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from
  other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than
  expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.
      Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German
  Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987
  tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the
  West German government in November.
      Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.
  But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign
  speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long
  term yields may to have to rise, economists said.
      Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to
  increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.
      The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in
  1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.
      West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased
  borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.
      Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he
  was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as
  raising indirect taxes.
      But few economists believe the government will be able to
  go through with its tax measures without increasing net
  borrowing.
      The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was
  wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986
  could be managed without increasing deficits.
      The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed
  a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final
  quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.
      The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of
  the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion
  marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it
  had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

8141,"JAPAN SAYS IT TRYING TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND
  Japan has assured a meeting
  of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic
  demand and restructure its economy.
      Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in
  addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a
  comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the
  1987/88 budget is approved.
      Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting,
  said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring
  the economy, but did not elaborate.
      Hata said protectionist pressures in the international
  economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits,
  payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.
      Despite great potential, developing economies are still
  confronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added.
      The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration
  last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequent
  trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.
      ""It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment
  to implementing that plan as scheduled,"" Hata said.
      Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations
  in some areas at the expense of others.
      In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is important
  for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve
  this end.
      As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April to
  fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for
  industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market
  more open to developing countries, he said.

  Australian Trade Minister
  John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform
  it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.
      In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers
  conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves
  all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing
  abilities of a number of developing countries.
       He said major countries should be showing leadership on
  this problem.
      ""We will be giving close attention to the processes in the
  OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and
  elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will
  be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to
  agricultural trade reform,"" Dawkins said.
      The Venice summit is scheduled for June.
      He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, the
  eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees
  the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further
  meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore
  confidence in the multilateral system.
      Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups
  established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September
  in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but
  it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these
  processes.
      ""We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on
  standstill and rollback are carried into practice.""
      The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global
  trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during
  the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years,
  he said.

  The entire British Petroleum Co PLC
  refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down
  following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the
  hydrocracker at the site, a refinery spokesman said.
      He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the
  19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery
  was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the
  main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said.
      But there was extensive damage to the central part of the
  32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to
  gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.
      The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a
  result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product
  from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam,
  a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd
  plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.
      He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was
  killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.
      The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of
  its capacity since the end of January while an extensive
  overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where
  the hydrocracker is sited, he said.
      This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but
  this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.
      Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare

      European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq

  bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of

  said in a statement.
      Undertakings to accept what is effectively a management

  Wickes International Corp, a member of the U.S. Wickes

  realise much of its investment.
      The offer would enable Wickes to become fully independent

  become members of the Cityquest board.
      The offer will be of 345p cash for every Wickes share.
  Wickes was last quoted at 345p compared with 275p at Friday's

  Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to
  salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States -
  sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its
  case and instructing its producers to cut output further.
      ""We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,""
  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy
  Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.
      ""If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will
  create very serious problems.""
      The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to
  meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral
  agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed
  to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to
  increase its imports of American semiconductors.
      Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by
  selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost
  American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory
  action.
      In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese
  chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost
  domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.
      Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit
  dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only
  memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a
  cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the
  year.
      He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of
  chips available for export through unregulated distributors in
  the so-called grey market.
      ""We have almost no grey market,"" he said. ""Supply is
  diminishing.""
      To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI
  called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,
  NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing
  specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary
  of &lt;Texas Instruments Inc>.
      Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the
  steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for
  U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.
      The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George
  Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
      The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are
  expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker
  Micron Technology Inc &lt;DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in
  Hong Kong.
      Yamamoto admitted that &lt;Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong
  Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but
  denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.
      ""If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We
  will present our rebuttal,"" he said.
      The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's
  advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above
  production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.
      He also called the case ""strange,"" but he stopped short of
  endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been
  trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron
  publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day
  they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who
  had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

  American Motors Corp said its auditors
  qualified the company's 1986 financial report.
      The report was qualified due to uncertainties surrounding
  the previously announced arbitration award against American
  Motors' former subsidiary, AM General Corp. The award is being
  contested.
      The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's &lt;C> proposal to
  take over American Motors.
      American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award,
  made to Emerson Electric Co &lt;EMR> in February, amounted to 60
  mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged
  the award.
      The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp &lt;QLTV>
  in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billion
  dlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM General
  last year sought protection under Chapter 11.
      The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson
  Electric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the
  development of certain components in the contract.
      The components were for the military's ""High Mobility
  Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle"" (HMMWV), American Motors said.
      In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed to
  indemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the
  Emerson Electric claims.
      AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court,
  and faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because of
  the LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of a

  Tonka Corp said it expects
  results for its fiscal first quarter to end April four, to
  decline from the record earnings of 3.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a
  share and revenues of 53.2 mln dlrs.
      The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower
  financial results to an an expected moderate decline in
  shipments of its Pound Puppies product line.
      Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain
  lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record
  results of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in net
  earnings or 1.47 dlrs a share.
      The company said its level of shipments is good despite a
  conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry
  wide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat
  from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down
  slightly from a year ago, it said.
      Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a
  return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which
  retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and
  time large shipments for the second half, it said.
      Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing
  last year's, bookings are ""very good"" for orders on several of
  its new product introductions for 1987.

  Bayerische Vereinsbank AG &lt;BVMG.F>
  expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987
  earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record
  levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.
      He told the annual news conference that possible credit
  risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had
  largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore
  unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.
      Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from
  222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit
  increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.
      Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business
  had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous
  year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased
  slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.
      Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business
  had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.
      Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln
  marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.
      The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which
  excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed
  two pct to 671 mln marks.
      The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5
  billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.
      It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage
  business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.
      The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business
  volume rose to 46 pct from 45.
      Hackl said that in January and February this year, the
  bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the
  sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own
  account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared
  with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

  Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's
  International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the
  fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested
  suitor.
      Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost
  a point when Coca Cola &lt;KO> said the rumors were untrue.
  However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more
  than three mln shares.
      Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they
  said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food
  restaurant chain was impossible.
      Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.
  Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a
  Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor
  and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.
      Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc &lt;BUD> and
  Pepsico Inc &lt;PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither
  of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's
  official.
      ""It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but
  its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,"" said
  Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.
      However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the
  current market rumors.
      Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been
  skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it
  views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become
  a competitor to them.
      ""I can't put another name on it,"" said Kidder peabody
  analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up
  Wendy's stock. ""It very well could be someone's interested.""
      But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time
  for Wendy's to be sold.
      ""They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've
  always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an
  offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the
  right time,"" Freedman said.
      ""If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control
  the situation,"" Freedman said.
      ""I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't
  think it's worth much more than where it is,"" said Joseph Doyle
  of Smith Barney.
      Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the ""burger
  wars"" between itself, McDonald's Corp &lt;MCD> and Pillsbury Co's
  &lt;PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food
  hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store
  sales last year, analysts said.
      Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced
  breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some
  analysts said the company should be bringing in new products,
  but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.
      There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be
  vulnerable to a takeover.
      James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth
  14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has
  improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high
  percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.
      ""They also have some attractive leaseholds on their
  restaurants,"" Murren said.
      Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,
  Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the
  fourth quarter. ""That was about the first time in seven
  quarters,"" he said.
      Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could
  be going on with Wendy's. ""My gut feeling is something's going
  to happen. I don't know what,"" she said.
      She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs
  per share.
      One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor
  because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead
  of Pepsi.
      Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by
  Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.
  Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.

8506,"IBM &lt;IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST
  International Business Machines Corp,
  hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by
  the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick
  Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.
      ""There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not
  until later this year,"" Martin said at a technology conference
  sponsored by the investment firm.
      Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product
  introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic
  improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.
      IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in
  mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at
  149-1/2 dlrs.
      Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company
  itself, have highlighted the external economic factors
  hampering IBM's growth.
      But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding
  the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and
  pointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view.
  ""By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,"" he said
  of DEC's line of VAX computers.
      In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible
  mid-range product line. A new computer code-named ""Fort Knox""
  was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range
  systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.
      Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the
  IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should
  be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. ""The major story will be a
  rebound in its mid-range business.""
      He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13
  pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth
  in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.
      High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming
  to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5
  pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will
  drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.
      By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16
  pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin
  said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of
  51.3 billion dlrs.
      Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings
  and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product
  introductions in the mid-range area.
      In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to
  DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were
  catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than
  stealing market share from one another.

  Brunswick Corp expects 1987 first
  quarter sales to be up ""dramatically"" and profits to ""do well,""
  chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securities
  analysts meeting.
      He declined to be more specific.
      In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of
  23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs.
      Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat
  manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first
  quarter report.
      Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from
  increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from
  acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an
  exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American
  Games, he said.
      He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving
  electronic features is being readied for test marketing this
  summer, and if successful, could ""materially benefit""
  operations.
      Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a
  health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.
      Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects
  the division to receive significant contracts in the near
  future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog
  stood at 425 mln dlrs.
      Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts
  Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently
  downgraded the company's debt which stood at about 665.4 mln
  dlrs at 1986 year end.
      ""We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down
  in the very near term,"" based on strong cash flow from
  Brunswick's expanded boat operations, Florjancic said.
      Shareholders at the company's April 27 annual shareholders

  The federal Securities and Exchange
  Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
  violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
  Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
  attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
      During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
  Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
      It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
  Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
  portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
      In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
  dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
  Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
  proceeds to buy TRE stock.
      Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
  pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
      The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
  was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
  holdings were working together without disclosing their
  cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities
  laws.
      One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether
  Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its
  intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln
  dlr bond offering.
      A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit
  of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC
  investigators and was cooperating with the probe.
      The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had
  been interviewed by the SEC probers.
      A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for
  information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.
      The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency
  and had heard nothing more since that time.
      ""To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target
  of a formal SEC investigation"" in connection with the TRE bid,
  he said.
      A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had
  underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:
      ""We had nothing to do with TRE.""

  U.S. drilling activity rose last week
  with the number of working rotary rigs up by 23 to 784, against

      The improvement was the first increase this year in the

      Among individual states, Texas and Oklahoma reported the

8563,"CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT
  Foreign currency futures
  markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries
  agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band,
  said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
  Exchange's, CME, executive committee.
      ""The target zone would not affect our market I think at
  all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy
  market,"" Melamed told Reuters in an interview.
      ""We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a
  four pct shift,"" he said, referring to permitted currency
  fluctuations in the early 1970s. ""One thing you can adjust is to
  make each contract a larger value.""
      As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental
  in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial
  to the Chicago exchange.
      Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can
  approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by
  governments to control currency fluctuations.
      ""They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an
  hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's
  unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.""
      The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the
  exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock
  index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would
  help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity
  markets on so-called ""triple-witching"" day.
      ""We think that the settlement in the morning will have a
  salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think
  this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change
  in the structure as of next June,"" when the move is scheduled to
  go into effect, he said.
      Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders
  of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would
  address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.
      Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring
  brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own
  account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in
  dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to
  the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.
      The changes ""will in time have an extremely positive effect
  on the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very
  instrumental in increasing volume over time,"" he said,
  predicting the increase would come within a year.
      Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said
  the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit
  on the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the
  Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could
  not be a temporary program.
      The CME also received ""many negative comments, many more
  than we anticipated,"" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission
  merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event
  the price approached the bottom limit.

  US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture
  of GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT> set up
  last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss
  of about 500 mln dlrs this year.
       David M. Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-based
  Southwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he did
  not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed
  that for the year the company should have about the same
  results as last year when it lost ""about 500 mln dlrs.""
       He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs
  over ""two plus years"" to set up its network.
  
      Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln
  dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order
  to lease its lines.
       He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic
  telephone line are now ""in the ground,"" and 7,000 miles are
  operable.
       By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company's
  subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead
  of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the
  second quarter.
      Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along
  microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more
  economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line
  the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information
  as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.
       ""By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to
  carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,"" Holland
  said.
      He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S.
  long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> about
  10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.
       Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower than
  ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone
  exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the
  companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting
  back its advertising by about 30 pct this year.
       At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total
  number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to
  last January.
      ""We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance
  of it,"" he said.
       Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he
  believed ATT ""should be given some flexibility, but should be
  regulated on pricing plans.""
       ""They're so dominant in the market place,"" he said, adding
  that ATT should be deregulated when ""there is true competition
  in the marketplace.""
       ""It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,"" he
  said, adding, ""maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say.""
      Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint's
  two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such
  as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on
  them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.
       ""They are two excellent partners who have stated time and
  time again their support of US Sprint,"" he said, adding that he
  was ""amazed"" at industry talk that the two companies might be
  arguing. ""There's no evidence of that,"" he said.
       He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues,
  number of customers and construction was on track, even ""ahead
  in many areas.""
      Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint
  currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in
  90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.
      ""We want to be in every country that ATT serves,"" he said.
      He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but
  was working on it.
       He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the
  forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September
  1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephone
  network.

  Britain has reaped profits by using a
  stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last
  autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor
  of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
      He said in a parliamentary debate, ""I can now tell the House
  (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves
  in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been
  repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.""
      Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures
  then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said.
  The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one
  point.
      During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson
  unveiled last week, he said that ""during the period of foreign
  exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat
  inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the
  end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene
  unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would
  enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather
  than the two pct the market was then pressing for.""
      He said that that one percentage point increase, effected
  in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half
  point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10
  pct.
      Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British
  reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England
  intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the
  authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and
  October 1986, government sources said.

  U.S. Trade Representative
  Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached
  a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the
  latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
  Trade (GATT).
      Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but
  told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved
  in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to
  improve the global situation in agriculture.
      Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to
  discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched
  in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.
      Yeutter said ""at least people seem to be going down the same
  road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is
  another matter entirely.""
      There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with
  the problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how we
  are going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said.
      However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of
  years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.
      ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough
  immense amounts of financial resources into the production of
  items that nobody wants to buy,"" he said.
      He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the
  financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more
  productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its
  inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he
  said.
      Individual segments in many countries may lose in the
  process, but it should result in a more rational system of
  world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.
      It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a
  relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26
  billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more
  than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,
  he said.
      Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in
  the negotiations, he said ""one has to be politically
  realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural
  trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to
  be as part of a larger package.""

  Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> is
  likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating
  profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in
  its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.
      Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from
  operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs
  compared with 1.23 billion in 1985.
      They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of
  about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay
  Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May.
      Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend
  for its ""A"" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents
  adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.
      Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the
  company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,
  analysts said.
      The company's aviation division consists of its majority
  stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in
  &lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct
  owned by Cathay.
      Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23
  billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel
  costs and greater traffic.
      Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the
  flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has
  since slipped to 50.23 pct.
      Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits
  rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.
      Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,
  estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.
      ""Much depends on properties,"" said Measor. ""And they did a lot
  better in the second half of the year.""
      Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire
  Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln
  compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs
  for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the
  same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the
  low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's
  properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential
  development and two luxury housing projects.
      Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in
  Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in
  second-half 1986.
      During the year property prices continued to rise as more
  people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,
  analysts said.
      ""At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling
  at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year
  ago,"" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)
  Ltd.
      Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in
  the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not
  provide income until the first stage is completed next year.
      The company also sold three properties and a part interest
  in a proposed hotel development, which should result in
  extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James
  Capel (Far East) Ltd.
      Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected
  to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and
  offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10
  mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

  targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources
  and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.
      He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association
  (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a
  package that would recognise the government's economic
  priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.
      Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review
  of oil taxation.
      Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted
  approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results
  in recent years.
      These include the reduction in the top marginal crude
  excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September
  1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore
  oil announced last September, he said.
      The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the
  elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost
  incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices
  and Australia's relatively low exploration levels.
      ""While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to
  an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour
  these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,
  which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still
  leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are
  going to do in major areas,"" Evans said.
      He said the government did not intend to change its
  resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before
  parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all
  exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.
      As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to
  highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a
  certain rate of return has been achieved for individual
  projects.
      APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because
  exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.
      Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more
  than anything on the government's desire to ensure the
  certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major
  investments have already been planned on the existing ground
  rules.

8599,"GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS - U.S.
  A successful new GATT
  (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to
  halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading
  partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
      Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial
  talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing
  because the multilateral system is inefficient.
      ""That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT
  round,"" he said. ""The very existence of all these bilateral
  irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral
  solutions to some of these problems.""
      The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta
  del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services
  were included in the negotiations for the first time.
      The growing debt burden of Latin American and African
  nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to
  succeed, he said.
      ""Clearly those countries need to develop their export
  endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and
  that's the basic objective of the new GATT round,"" he said.
      But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It
  will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,
  but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.
      ""It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because
  these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,""
  he said.
      ""They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round
  as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making
  possible debt amortisation in the future,"" he said.

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with
  the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said.
      At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and
  Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm
  U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices
  in semiconductors.
      Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled
  meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council
  to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact
  with the U.S.
      That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,
  calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets
  and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.
      Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live
  up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.
      Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the
  pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out
  Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.
      In his letter, the contents of which were released today,
  Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March
  showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices
  in Asian markets.
      In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI
  vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested
  the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into
  allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

  World Bank president Barber Conable
  pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower
  world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its
  protected economy was needed.
      Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,
  he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the
  economy and deregulate trade policy.
      Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which
  cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third
  World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs
  from the World Bank in the past 20 years.
      Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300
  mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was
  prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to
  lower oil and primary commodity prices.
      ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are
  consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he
  said.
      He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last
  year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the
  difficulties now faced by other countries.
      Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the
  dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and
  has announced a series of measures since May intended to
  stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise
  the economy.
      However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics
  and high tariff barriers remain in place.
      Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met
  14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's
  borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the

  Industrial holding company Williams

      The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams
  shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share
      Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last
  night of 397p.
      A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits
  of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to
  propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash
  alternative.
      The offer will include a partial convertible alternative
  under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69
  mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their
  ordinary share allocations.
      The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one
  Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a
  value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.
      Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986
  rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.
      Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in
  the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it
  centred on &lt;Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then
  switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.
      Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with
  Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which
  replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also
  result from normal trading.
      In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise
  in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover
  that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln
      Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a
  market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of
  acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its
  capitalisation up to around 380 mln.
      The convertible offer would be on the basis of four
  Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a
  share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of
  400.2p a share.
      The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price
  down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.
      Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or
  0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.
      There was no immediate response from Norcros.

  The council of the

      The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly
  disappointed by the Australian government's position on
  taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy
  Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.
      As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target
  any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to
  secondary taxation of petroleum.
      APEA had expected the government to make positive responses
  to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of
  existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and
  development, the council said.
      It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by
  Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed
  with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.
      Evans told the conference the government did not plan to
  accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow
  deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.
      ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of
  unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore
  area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is
  profit based,"" the APEA council said.
      The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil
  exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the
  industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's
  problems, the council said.
      The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory
  secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major
  disincentives at a time of low oil prices.

  Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr
  purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
  brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
  are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
      The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
  is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
  position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing
  capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
  financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
  Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
      The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
  by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
  Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
  Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
  assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
      Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
  sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
      The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
  joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
  management, market research, and consulting on financing.
      Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
  world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
      The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
  deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
  insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
      The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
  insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
  Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
  and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
  instruments.
      Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
  appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
  board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
  limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
  problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for
  blue-chip organisations,"" he said.
      ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
  industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a
  historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
  there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.""
      Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
  Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
  yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
  to 18 pct, he said.
      To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
  gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
  spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory
  environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
  diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
  in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
  fund management,"" Smithson said.

  Canadian Trade Minister Pat
  Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world

  responsive over time.
      She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade
  ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted
  adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture
  should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries
  should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that
  distorted world prices, Carney said.
      Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should
  not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing
  legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must
  be implemented collectively.
      Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are
  basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals

      European trade sources said the conference welcomed the

      Carney said there was a lot of political will among the
  ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under
  four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to
  be done in a balanced way.
      ""The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a
  broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early
  conclusion,"" she said.
      However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,

  Philippine Secretary of
  Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed
  doubts about agreements produced at international conferences,
  said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.
      Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave
  ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine
  issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.
      ""Also, the role of the developing countries has been
  emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the
  perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich
  countries,"" he added in an interview with Reuters.
      ""In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for
  discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be
  of more benefit to the developed countries,"" he said.
      Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the
  Uruguay round was meant to be a ""shining act of faith"" in the
  world trade system.
      Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of
  trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery
  to make it more responsive.
      He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but
  faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very
  high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South
  Korea as examples.
      He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New
  Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to

  U.S. Trade Representative
  Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached
  a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the
  latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
  Trade (GATT).
      Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but
  told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved
  in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to
  improve the global situation in agriculture.
      Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to
  discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched
  in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.
      Yeutter said ""at least people seem to be going down the same
  road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is
  another matter entirely.""
      There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with
  the problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how we
  are going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said.
      However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of
  years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.
      ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough
  immense amounts of financial resources into the production of
  items that nobody wants to buy,"" he said.
      He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the
  financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more
  productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its
  inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he
  said.
      Individual segments in many countries may lose in the
  process, but it should result in a more rational system of
  world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.
      It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a
  relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26
  billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more
  than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,
  he said.
      Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in
  the negotiations, he said ""one has to be politically
  realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural
  trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to
  be as part of a larger package.""

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with

      At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and
  Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm
  U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices
  in semiconductors.
      Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled
  meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council
  to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact
  with the U.S.
      That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,
  calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets
  and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.
      Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live
  up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.
      Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the
  pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out
  Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.
      In his letter, the contents of which were released today,
  Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March
  showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices
  in Asian markets.
      In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI
  vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested
  the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into
  allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

  Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr
  purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
  brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
  are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
      The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
  is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
  position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing
  capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
  financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
  Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
      The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
  by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
  Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
  Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
  assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
      Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
  sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
      The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
  joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
  management, market research, and consulting on financing.
      Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
  world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
      The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
  deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
  insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
      The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
  insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
  Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
  and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
  instruments.
      Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
  appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
  board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
  limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
  problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for
  blue-chip organisations,"" he said.
      ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
  industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a
  historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
  there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.""
      Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
  Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
  yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
  to 18 pct, he said.
      To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
  gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
  spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory
  environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
  diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
  in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
  fund management,"" Smithson said.

  fired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf
  naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.
      ""These missiles pack a fairly big punch,"" he told Reuters.

      Tension in the Gulf has risen since U.S. Officials last
  week broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkworm
  missiles.
      The U.S. Has said it will not allow Iran to use the
  missiles to choke off oil shipments and has offered its
  warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries.
      But Tehran denied last Sunday it intended to threaten Gulf
  shipping and warned the U.S. Any interference in the region
  would meet a strong response.
      The British naval source said the Silkworms were in place
  at at least two sites around the Strait of Hormuz, but would
  not give the exact location.

  Woolworth Holdings Plc &lt;WLUK.L> which

      The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by
  some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc
  &lt;DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a
  major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most
  profitable retailing group in the U.K.
      It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look
  for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses.
      Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger
  talks with the high street pharmacist &lt;Underwoods Plc> had been
  called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended
  offer for &lt;Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc>.
      The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct
  and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of
  45.5 mln making it the largest single component.
      The company said that the improvement had been achieved by
  substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the
  opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins.
      In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail
  profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain
  reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.
      The company said its property operations would increase
  substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with
  developers &lt;Rosehaugh Plc>.
      The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from
  Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge.
      The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts.
  As a result, the group's shares rose strongly, peaking at 865p
  from last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT.

  A successful new GATT
  (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to
  halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading

      Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial
  talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing
  because the multilateral system is inefficient.
      ""That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT
  round,"" he said. ""The very existence of all these bilateral
  irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral
  solutions to some of these problems.""
      The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta
  del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services
  were included in the negotiations for the first time.
      The growing debt burden of Latin American and African
  nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to
  succeed, he said. ""Clearly those countries need to develop their
  export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen
  and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.""
      But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It
  will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,
  but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.
      ""It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because
  these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,""

  as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making

8747,"INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY
  World Bank President Barber Conable
  linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's
  sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and
  dismantle protectionist barriers.
      ""We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the
  adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation
  of the economy,"" Conable told a press conference at the end of a
  three-day visit to Jakarta.
      Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's
  hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the
  government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.
      The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr
  trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on
  the economic policies Indonesia adopted.
      But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto
  and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific
  policy changes.
      ""The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian
  government. We are not here to dictate to them,"" he stated.
      Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly
  hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues
  from crude exports in half.
      Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning
  with Suharto.
      He voiced support for measures already taken, including
  September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to
  deregulate imports and stimulate exports.
      ""The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in
  a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of
  today's world,"" he said.
      The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the
  past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.
      The World Bank would probably like to see further
  dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce
  Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics
  and cement, western bankers and diplomats said.
      The government has already said it will announce further
  deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also
  considering selling off loss-making state companies.
      Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find
  funds to cover its share of development projects, which
  otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im
  bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month.

  Norway's Draugen oil field and will declare the field

      Pending government approval of the scheme, the field could
  come on stream in 1992, making it Norway's northermost field
  development and the first such project on the Haltenbanken
  tract off central Norway.
      Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, a
  Shell spokesman said.
      Shell has not released projected output levels for the
  field, where water depth is 240-270 meters.
      The spokesman said the field's partners have agreed to
  develop Draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concrete
  gravity-base platform.
      The scheme also proposes using remote subsea production
  wells to tap the field's reservoir, estimated to contain 375

  transport oil from the field by ship.
      Partners on Draugen are Shell, the operator, with a 30 pct

  increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in

      The company said that its 1986 performance was best
  reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln

      Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover
  of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business
  profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo
  dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a

  U.S. Department of Energy Secretary
  John Herrington said he was ""optimistic"" about the chances of
  providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas
  producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from
  some members of the Reagan administration.
      Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a
  breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for
  a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was ""heavy and strong""
  largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could
  eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the
  agriculture industry.
      Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry
  were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a
  comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be
  jeopardized by rising oil imports.
      In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and
  Development Corp &lt;MND> chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington
  said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import
  tarrif. ""We intend to keep that debate open,"" Herrington said.
      However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters that
  the new report shows an oil import fee ""is not economical.""
      Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on
  oil imports would cause the nation's gross national product to
  drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.
      Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who
  requested the comprehensive national security study, was
  committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.
      ""I'm quite confident he understands the problems and is
  prepared to do something about it,"" Herrington said.

  Sudan has rejected a demand by the
  International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because
  such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the
  official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported.
      Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his
  government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies
  on basic consumer goods.
      SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation,
  said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum
  yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan.
      Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is
  some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it
  ineligible for fresh loans in February last year.
      In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of
  its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange
  rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency.
      Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors
  for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations
  had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices.
  Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar
  for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers.
      Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar
  was sold at 5.5 pounds today.
      With stringent import regulations and the government
  increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars
  are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring
  countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire.
      Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF
  and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal
  talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's
  economic performance.
      The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic
  recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious
  attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade
  its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears.
      This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of
  health from the IMF that it could take to Western government
  creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to
  reschedule debt payments.
      Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to
  members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said.
      Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF
  representative had told him the fund's executive board was ""very
  pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past
  couple of months.""
      The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director
  Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan
  owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.
      Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs
  but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the
  fiscal year ending next June 30.

  Robert Heller, a member of the Board

  prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and

      Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Heller
  said, ""A broadly based commodity price index may be worth
  exploring"" as a guide to monetary policy.
      ""In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might
  be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetary
  policy might be eased,"" he said.
      Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement
  problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give
  ""early warning"" signs of wholesale and retail changes.
      ""There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in
  commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis,"" Heller said in a
  prepared text.
      ""But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policy
  action might be considered,"" he said.
      Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an
  indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to
  stabilized currency exchange rates.
      Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices
  for them are more consistent than for other types of goods, he
  said.
      He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize
  export commodity prices for developing countries by using a

  Cyacq Corp, an investor group bidding
  for Cyclops Corp, said it amended its outstanding 92.50 dlrs a
  share tender offer for Cyclops to eliminate two conditions and
  modify a third one.
      The group, which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a
  unit of Citicorp &lt;CCI>, said it also obtained additional
  financing commitments, including an increased commitment from
  Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.
      The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for
  non-public information about Cyclops that was previously
  provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that
  the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's
  published financial projections.
      Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group, which has a
  90.25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding. Dixons
  said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight.
      The condition that was modified, which required Cyacq to be
  satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons
  were rescinded or ineffective, now says Cyclops shall not have
  paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the
  consummation of Cyacq's offer.
      Cyacq's amended offer expires midnight New York time on
  April three, 1987, unless extended.
      Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group/Business
  Credit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln
  dlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln
  dlrs from 250 mln dlrs.
      Additionally, the Citicorp unit and Audio/Video have
  increased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs. Of the
  new total, 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp.
      Cyacq said it estimates that it needs 407.5 mln dlrs to buy
  all Cyclops shares that may be tendered and pay related fees
  and expenses.
      It said it is seeking to arrange the balance of about 25.5
  mln dlrs necessary to complete the offer.
      All previously announced conditions regarding the lending
  group led by Manufacturers Hanover remain in effect, except
  that the loans are subject to the concurrent receipt by Cyacq
  of equity contributions and other financing of not less than
  210.5 mln dlrs for the tender offer facility and 213.5 mln dlrs
  for the merger facility.
      Cyacq also said the Citicorp unit had received no
  indications of interest in an alternative offer it had made
  from Dixons, Cyclops or Alleghany Corp &lt;Y>, which has agreed to
  acquire Cyclops' industrial group from Dixons.
      Under the alternative offer, the Citicorp unit, with
  Cyacq's approval, proposed to acquire the industrial group from
  Dixons.

894,"JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS
  The Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip
  exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a
  U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese
  chipmakers doubt its usefulness.
      A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to
  issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are
  authorised exporters.
      Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be
  required to show such a certificate, but those without it will
  not automatically be denied licences, he said.
      But some industry officials predicted any government
  measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the
  world semiconductor market remained weak.
      U.S. Government and industry officials have complained
  repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below
  cost to third countries despite the July agreement.
      Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of
  cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by
  third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between
  low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs
  and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.
      The MITI spokesman said, ""If the percentage of grey market
  is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are
  distributing their products through their sales network knowing
  they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask
  them what they are doing to reduce the figure.""
      MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by
  10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.
      But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. ""As long
  as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market
  prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to
  make money,"" a Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> spokesman said.

8940,"KODAK &lt;EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS
  Eastman Kodak Co said it will
  reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber
  operations of its Eastman Chemicals division.
      A company spokesman said the company will take ""some
  writeoff"" in connection with the action in the first quarter
  and there will probably be a further ""carryover"" writeoff in
  the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of
  plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected
  with the staff cuts.
      Kodak said the division will discontinue production of
  polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its
  Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100
  mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,
  mostly in Columbia.
      The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in
  Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,
  and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in
  Kingsport, Tenn.
      Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved
  through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan
  for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products
  Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense
  Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be
  completed by April 30.
      Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance
  have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY
  production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the
  business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman
  since last year.
      The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel
  polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from
  500 mln due to lesser demand.
      It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase
  in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.
      Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport
  units affected about 10,800.
      The company spokesman later said the charges will be
  insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

8943,"ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET
  The shareholders of Illinois
  Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many
  Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote
  Wednesday on its possible dissolution.
      The directors of the company called a special meeting and
  recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume
  and increasing costs.
      Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout
  of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital
  stock, led to the call for dissolution.
      The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing
  houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional
  and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.
      Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm
  cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded
  Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.
      But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer
  Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through
  a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.
      With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade
  futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president
  of the co-op.
      Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a
  cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A
  notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became
  affiliated with Cargill, Inc.
      Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional
  cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,
  of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries
  in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and
  Harvest States in Minneapolis.
      Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative
  Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.
      Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives
  are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one
  cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.
      Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm
  cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few
  major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.
      Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the
  National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives
  exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.
      ""The period we've gone through in the past five years has
  been quite a crunch,"" he said. ""There's been a lot of
  consolidation in the marketing co-ops.""
      One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the
  major commercials for export, rather than exporting it
  themselves, losing potential profits.
      But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the
  multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers
  Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served ""to make
  folks gun-shy,"" Hanes said.
      Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is
  approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather
  than a change in U.S. agricultural economics.
      A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm
  ""was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of
  money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of
  doing business.""
      ""We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,"" he said.
  ""But there are lot of people out there to do business with.
  There are plenty of capable firms.""
      Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing
  with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures
  through a Chicago-based cooperative.
      ""In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to
  individuals, there would be economic savings,"" he said but
  added, ""The times change and with changing times, come
  different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.""
      Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had
  nothing to do with its profitability. ""I would guarantee you
  that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy
  organization.""
      In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois
  Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members'
  equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for
  the most recent year has not been filed.
      Under the cooperative system, income from operations is
  returned as ""patronage refunds"" to the members.
      Income and refunds in the past five years have been
  declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op
  reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0
  mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,
  1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.
      ""You're dealing with substantially lower volume,"" Mulligan
  said. ""Lower volume translates into higher costs.""
      According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark
  owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common
  shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.
      Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital
  Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the
  figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.
  Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume
  and, as a result, changes from year to year.
      However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet
  minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark
  pulled out.

  Heavy buying by speculators boosted
  Conrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29, higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash
  tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc &lt;IV>.
      ""It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria,"" said one arbitrageur,
  referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per
  share and ended when ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> found a white knight
  willing to bid 36.50 dlrs.
      For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed
  like an ""appropriate price."" Another said ""it's too early to
  project the outcome.""
      ""The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr
  offer is inadequate,"" the second arbitrageur said. But he added
  it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more
  than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.
      He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and
  there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is
  able to thwart Mark IV.
      Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board
  studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it
  would make a recommendation by April 17.
      A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in
  several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a
  determined bidder. ""They're not beginners,"" he said.
      Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find
  another buyer. ""It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,""
  he said. ""There is only a small universe of people who would
  want to own the company as it's presently structured.""
      Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,
  aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding
  equipment and other products.
      ""I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for
  those who can take the risk,"" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at
  Milwaukee Co.
      He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV ""fair value but on
  the low side."" ""I don't think management was looking for a
  buyer in any way before this offer,"" he said.
      Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has
  developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche
  markets. He said management has done a good job of turning
  around the telephone answering machine business.

  The U.S. House Foreign Affairs
  Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now
  kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a
  threat to U.S. national security.
      The Democratic-controlled committee said the
  administration's export control policies, which restrict
  shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's
  record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.
      The committee said the legislation will cut government red
  tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with
  foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available
  from other countries.
      Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic
  Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost
  the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.
      ""This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the
  trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,"" the
  Washington Democrat said.
      The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift
  controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over
  the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable
  controls.
      Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of
  technology such as medical instruments.
      It would also give the Commerce Department primary
  authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit
  the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing
  requests to export highly-sensitive technology.

  William Bywater, president of the

  Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in

      He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the
  semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from
  becoming ""one of the world's industrial lightweights.""
      Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy
  Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what
  sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged 
  violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.
      The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end
  selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home
  market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego
  antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.
      But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped
  dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country
  dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.
      Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,
  ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to
  force prices up and end the dumping.
      Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science
  Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new
  electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the
  U.S. industory more competitive.
      But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to
  pass and that action was required now to help the depressed
  electronic industry.
      Bywater said, ""I urge the Reagan Administration to take full
  and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the
  retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT

  The Philippines must devalue the peso if
  it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning
  Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.
      ""The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports
  more competitive,"" Monsod said an interview. ""No question about
  it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South
  Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies
  deliberately undervalued their currencies.""
      The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is
  currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.
      Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does
  not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and
  able to continue to respond to market conditions.
      Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from
  the point of view of finance. ""If the dollar rate goes higher,
  our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the
  financing is very difficult,"" she said. ""But I am looking at it
  in terms of the economy.""
      She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.
      ""I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to
  become uncompetitive because then we are dead.""
      Monsod said, ""The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is
  a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)
  of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic
  thing.""
      Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct
  in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was
  expected to touch five pct this year.
      He said the government and the International Monetary Fund
  had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.
      The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the

  shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
  a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
  752,297 class B shares outstanding.
      Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
  class B shares outstanding.
      Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
  class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
  power of the class B shares.
      Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
  by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>.
      Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
  class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
  the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
  Resorts.
      Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
  merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
  special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
  exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
      This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
  the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
  operations.
      A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
  two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
  because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
  asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
      The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
  that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
  Denver oilman.
      Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles
  public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was
  not immediately available for comment.
      Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment, as was a
  spokesman for the Crosby estate.

9076,"CANADA VOWS TO FIGHT U.S. POTASH ACTION
  External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
  today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action
  against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against
  raising the alarm too early in the dispute.
      In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations,
  the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously
  Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million
  U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.
      ""We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that
  Canadian interests are well protected,"" Clark told the House of
  Commons in the daily question period.
      But he said the opposition parties should be careful ""not
  to raise false alarms too early.""
      The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's
  trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash
  producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government
  subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments.
      Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8
  mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third
  going to the U.S.
      Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,
  comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.
      In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the
  ruling as just another ""trade harrassment"" from the U.S. and
  criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be
  protected.
      ""We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the
  softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,""
  Axworthy said.
      Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to
  impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier
  this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with
  the U.S.
      Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to
  world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
  and Trade.
      But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example
  of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral
  irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the
  U.S.
      ""What we are seeking to do is put in place a better
  system,"" Clark said.
      Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed
  confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem
  stems from low international commodity prices and not
  government subsidies.
      ""The reality of the problem and the injury is caused
  worldwide,"" he said. ""It's caused by a downturn in the
  commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer,
  nitrogen fertilizer or whatever.""

9110,"MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS
  Automobile dealerships have become
  large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1
  billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.
      Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and
  buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the
  largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts
  say.
      Retail car sales ""are at a point of transition. There's not
  much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking"" about
  ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University
  of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
      The retail car market is ""much more freeform now"" than it
  was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit
  analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.
      Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.
  Dealerships sold one kind of car--a ""Chevy"" or a Ford or a
  Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold
  738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National
  Automobile Dealers Association.
      That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen
  Beatle--began to gain popularity. The ""Bug"" caused ""a
  rebellion"" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from
  restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,
  says Jauppi.
      One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has
  been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,
  the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold
  increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.
      ""I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln
  dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,""
  says Cole.
      ""There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that
  make cars,"" he says.
      With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying
  up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend
  will let up.
      Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.
  Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by
  1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800
  principal owners today.
      Many dealers are experimenting with owning several
  franchises, some of which might compete against each other. ""It
  used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a
  Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,"" Jauppi says.
      As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about
  the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned
  or open international operations.
      Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,
  ""are obviously thinking of very seriously,"" says Cole.
      Although some say the franchise system might get in the way
  of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to
  trading in car dealer shares.
      ""Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing
  the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those
  cars. It could happen any time,"" Jauppi says.
      ""If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the
  scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to
  resist taking them public,"" said another analyst.
      And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become
  international.
      ""We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks
  that are worldwide,"" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted
  particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster
  than the U.S., he says.
      ""It's not totally off the wall,"" says Cole.

9134,"EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G-6 LEVELS - SUMITA
  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
  said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
  agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
      Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
  economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
  fundamentals.
      Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
  bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
  agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
  to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
  necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was
  likely.
      But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
  levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
  fundamentals.
      In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
  the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
  currencies around their then current levels.
      Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
  the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
  yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
  nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
  surrounding trade tensions.
      U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
  that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
  dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
  U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
      The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
  moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
  He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
  remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
  rise of the yen.
      The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
  in line with the Paris accord, he added.

9139,"JARDINE MATHESON PROFITS SEEN UP SHARPLY IN 1986
  A strong performance by its retail
  businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings
  Ltd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in
  1986, stock analysts said.
      They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of
  between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln
  in 1985.
      The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay
  a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a
  share in 1985.
      James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's
  1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income
  to retail sales.
      Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its
  franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury
  goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.
      Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine
  Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he
  estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465
  mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.
      But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35
  pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall to
  about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.
      The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong
  Kong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.
      Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as
  a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book
  revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the
  year as part of its retail business, which will increase its
  overall retail income figures.
      Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply
  increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct
  share of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.
      Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986
  of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.
      Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments
  of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln
  dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about
  the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.
      But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln
  dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.
      Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations
  that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its
  diverse interests.
      It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both
  Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine
  Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.
      A company statement issued last month said the firm will
  use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an
  additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.
      Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake
  in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is
  likely to develop its own business, analysts said.
      ""The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability
  to creatively structure some new acquisitions,"" said Hargreaves
  of Hoare Govett.
      He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key
  sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its
  existing business.

  China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen
  International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about
  14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of
  operation.
      General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit
  forecast, saying targets were under study.
      Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's
  outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,
  up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings
  rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.
      Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent
  company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries &lt;Xiamen
  International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and &lt;Luso
  International Bank Ltd> in Macao.
      The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985
  but did not officially open until March 1986.
      Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign
  partner, Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut
  last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign
  banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three
  Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.
      Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were
  unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a
  loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of
  268,000 dlrs in 1985.
      The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of
  China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,
  Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and
  Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).
      One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the
  same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on
  unequal terms with state-owned banks.
      The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost
  saturated, he added.
      Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted
  from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the
  foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced
  internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.
      Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International
  Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the
  state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight
  foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong
  Kong or overseas Chinese banks.

      It said the existing five-year agreement, due to expire

      Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk

  The Ferruzzi Group's holding company
  Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European

  agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a
  statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.
      When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it
  said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.
      Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several
  clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.
      It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories
  employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community
  countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC
  states.
      The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of
  1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or
  about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of
  cereals.
      Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend

9170,"MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES
  Middle East currency dealers meet in
  Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their
  business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from
  the Arab world to London.
      The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association
  also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf
  currency system is more real that at any time this decade.
      Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these
  issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to
  be major talking points.
      About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --
  including some in London and other major non-Arab financial
  centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins
  on on Saturday.
      Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a
  growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,
  by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in
  London.
      The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,
  foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in
  Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based
  banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.
      As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade
  finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain
  ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.
  Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.
      The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab
  Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased
  their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading
  representative offices to branch status to allow dealing.
      One economist said: ""It is cheaper to run a riyal book in
  London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...
  There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.""
      Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit
  taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,
  &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November
  1986.
      The major market maker has traditionally been London-based
  consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom
  joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its
  London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.
      One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: ""Inevitably the
  volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new
  licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most
  of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.""
      Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi
  riyal market is difficult to quantify.
      Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency
  deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped
  to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986
  from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.
      The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal
  trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very
  quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now
  staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect
  &lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.
      Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market
  moving completely out of the region, partly because of local
  demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian
  Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate
  internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue
  speculation.
      There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market
  shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain
  and London is still limited.
      But for the first time since the formation of the six
  nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs
  that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.
      Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final
  currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,
  Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
      But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary
  System style with a common peg have been discussed at high
  level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected
  to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.
      One dealer said: ""A lot of exposure is being given to
  discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the
  end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.""
      One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.
      The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated
  since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently
  linked to a basket of currencies while the other five
  currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the
  U.S. Dollar.
      Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation
  against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,
  but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of
  7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.
      Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued
  slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the
  undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.

  Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos
  (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlruntied loan from the
  Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum
  Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.
      No further details on the loan were immediately available.
      Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion
  in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in
  the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.
      The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on
  the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and
  construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.
      The project also includes construction of liquified
  petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional
  crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia
  complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion
  of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.
      Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and
  materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will
  enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz
  rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some
  LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan
  diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.

  1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.
      The company estimated parent company current losses at 15

      Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise
  and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report

      The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39
  billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from
  exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.
      Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth

  Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.
      Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual
  premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by
  38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first
  quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market
  leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in
  the U.K.
      Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion.
  Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting
  results in the second half.
      Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio
  dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left
  the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.
      Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg,
  nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales
  rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.

  Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Is
  expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987

      Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln
  dlrs, the ministry document said. The investment was mainly in
  electronics, trading, food and service industries.
      Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial
  Development and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is
  due to planned government incentives and growing willingness
  among Taiwanese to invest abroad.
      Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or
  June, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation
  requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10
  mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.

  international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net
  profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the
  profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
      The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a
  domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
      It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln
  mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover
  possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary
  because of recent declines in raw material prices.
      Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in
  prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.
      It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary
  share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held
  largely by family foundations.
      Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation
  certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield

  Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire
  Properties expects further good results both from properties
  under development for sale and from its investment property
  portfolio.""
      He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The
  company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78
  billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.
      Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs
  mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific
  Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>.
      Miles said the company will use the money to develop its
  business, primarily in Hong Kong.
      Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from
  70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25
  pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the
  enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust
  and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986
  profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.
      Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's
  flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.
      He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of ""a
  marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with
  savings in fuel costs.""
      ""At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable
  for the rest of this year,"" he said, ""though there might be a bit
  of increase later this year.''
      Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service
  operations, even though the marine sector is generally
  depressed. ""Obviously the marine industry is not getting any
  better,"" he said.

  revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with

  oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last

  sources said.
      They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise
  des Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh
  subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the
  reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.
      Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi,
  last November 25.
      The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living
  quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production
  platform.
      Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible
  but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.
      Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume
  at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and
  the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.
      The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in
  remaining accomodations, the sources said.
      Facilities being installed to protect the field include
  aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing
  for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources
  said.
      Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab
  Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15
  mln bpd production, the sources said.
      They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field,

  CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected to
  pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share
  after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985.
      The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net
  earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against
  analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln.
      CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until
  later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation
  to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free
  to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the
  full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid.
      The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the
  fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at
  the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.
      Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with
  dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation
  legislation before determining the final payout, it said.
      Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor
  year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of
  gold producers.
      Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars
  declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.
      Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility
  and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to
  substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.
      World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have
  steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,
  but overcapacity continues, CRA said.
      Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said
  Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs
  while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.
      Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs
  against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.
      Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations
  incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in
  1985, CRA said.
      Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs
  against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln
  from 2.8 mln.
      CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project
  amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.
      CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary
  loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange
  losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.
      Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for
  closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in
  future tax provisions, CRA said.
      Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs
  before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The
  strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights
  issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt
  to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.
      CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985
  mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0
  mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.

  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita

  agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
      Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
  economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
  fundamentals.
      Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
  bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
  agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
  to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
  necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was

  levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
  fundamentals.
      In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
  the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
  currencies around their then current levels.
      Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
  the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
  yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
  nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
  surrounding trade tensions.
      U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
  that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
  dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
  U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
      The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
  moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
  He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
  remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
  rise of the yen.
      The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
  in line with the Paris accord, he added.

925,"CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.
  China called on the United States to
  remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
  status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
      But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
  13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
  inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
  Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
       The official International Business newspaper today
  published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
  visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
       ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
  restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
  for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
  exports,"" the editorial said.
       ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
  favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
  into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
       ""Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
  recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
  influences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added
       The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
  counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
  that ""all kinds of difficulties and restrictions"" were preventing
  bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
       He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
  technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
       The paper also printed a table showing that, since
  bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every
  year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
  at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
       A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept
  Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
  goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While
  U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.
       He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will
  have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several
  laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
       The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,
  China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and
  Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and ""not be
  dominated or controlled by international Communism.""
       The official said China was well aware of the laws, some
  of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that
  there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change
  them.
       China has been the subject of about a dozen cases
  involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,
  which the U.S. Side won, he said.
       But, for the first time, China signed last week an
  agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
  exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
  lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
       Another diplomat said willingness to provide such
  voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
  bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.
       ""China has the potential to disrupt world markets,
  especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous
  about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other
  centralled planned economies in GATT,"" the diplomat said.
       Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of
  GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports
  or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
       In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.
  Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed
  China's interest in participating in GATT.
       ""The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished
  overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large
  economy of the Chinese type,"" Shultz said.
       ""China can play an important role by actively joining GATT
  discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
  enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further
  develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
  benefit from its GATT participation,"" he said.
       The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership
  are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
  regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
  for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
       In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT
  last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic
  system and replacing mandatory instruction with ""guidance
  planning"" and economic levers.
       The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to
  do.

9253,"OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT
  Papua New Guinea
  (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the
  Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun
  Fesharaki said here.
      The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG
  on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told
  the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual
  conference.
      Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West
  Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific
  petroleum outlook.
      With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,
  PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki
  said.
      The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best
  oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.
      The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper
  distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at
  about 500 mln barrels.
      PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with
  no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.
      ""We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and
  discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to
  (light) Bass Strait crude,"" Fesharaki said.
      There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to
  be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is
  capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.
      But prices should be somewhat higher than the present
  levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.
      The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large
  prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG.

  British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
  denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her
  government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil
  prices.
      She said the government was determined not to intervene to
  influence production decisions by oil companies operating in
  the North Sea.
      ""We believe these must be a matter for the commercial
  judgment of the oil companies,"" she told the Arabic language
  daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit
  to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
      Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall
  in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as
  in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.
      British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to
  increase in the future, she said.
      ""We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other
  OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility
  for both producer and consumer countries,"" Thatcher said.
      ""On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which

  The House Ways and Means Committee
  completed action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws,
  chairman Dan Rostenkowski said.
      The committee's consideration of one of the most
  controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus
  countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States,
  was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its
  sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.
      Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was not
  certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal
  would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10
  pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such
  as Japan.
      The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President
  Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate
  international trade agreements but it allows him to wave
  retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.
  economy.
      The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions
  to grant domestic industries import relief.
      It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade
  practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These
  powers are currently held by President Reagan.
      The administration has strongly objected to this transfer
  of authority from Reagan to Yeutter.
      The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate
  multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into
  other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April.

  Utilicorp United Corp
  said it expects to report 1987 first quarter earnings of about

  190 mln dlrs.
      In the comparable quarter a year ago, Utilicorp earned 8.5
  mln dlrs or 87 cts on revenues of 203 mln dlrs.
      There are 9.6 mln shares outstanding this year, up from the
  8.5 mln shares in 1986, Utilicorp's president Richard Green
  told financial analysts here.
      First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution
  of West Virginia Power, which became a division on March 1,
  1987, Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts.
      Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating
  and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate
  increases in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas and Colorado, he said.
      However, Utilicorp's Missouri Public Service division is
  experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized
  in September 1986, he noted.
      Of Utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first
  quarter, about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric
  operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas
  operations, he said.
      Operating income derived from electric operations in the
  first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs,
  while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln
  dlrs, Green said.
      Green told analysts that Utilicorp received regulatory
  approval from various states and the Federal Energy Regulatory
  Commission to reincorporate in Delaware, effective April one.
      Utilicorp signed an agreement with Cominco Ltd of Vancouver
  to extend the deadline to May 31, 1987, for completion of the
  company's purchase of West Kootenay Power and Light of British
  Columbia, due to a longer than expected regulatory approval
  process, he said.
      Hearings were completed in February and a decision by the

  BAT Industries Plc &lt;BTI.L> 1986 results,
  which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the
  company was in a strong position and that its shares were
  probably undervalued, share analysts said.
      BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading
  after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p
  earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39
  billion pre-tax.
      Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock
  market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT
  shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the
  share price.
      ""In the current market, people almost expect companies to
  beat expectations,"" said one analyst, adding that pretax profits
  of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.
      BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985
  pretax profit of 1.17 billion.
      Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its
  underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the
  tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.
      BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the
  tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74
  pct four years ago.
      Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company
  declining further as other sectors increased in importance.
      He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial
  services, in particular in the U.S.
      Sheehy also said the group had ""no sizeable acquisitions"" in
  sight in the near future.
      Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in the
  U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.
      Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16
  pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make
  major acquisitions, they said.

  Canada's federal government
  will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that
  includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a
  company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy
  Minister Marcel Masse announced.
      The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into
  the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one
  billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.
      The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on
  or after April 1, 1987.
      Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid
  package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.
      The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and
  Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments
  that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.
      Masse said the program will probably generate new
  employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.
      He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and
  development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil
  prices fell during the first half of 1986.
      Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided
  to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying
  companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full
  value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately
  benefit from tax benefits, he said.
      The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid
  program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson
  is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax
  reform proposals later this spring.
      An important feature of the aid program is a decision to
  let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to
  benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to
  only participating companies, he said.
      Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it
  easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and
  development, Masse said.
      He told reporters his department is still considering
  whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for
  the subsidy.

  Middle South Utilities Inc is taking a
  conversative approach to formulating a new common stock
  dividend policy, chairman Edwin Lupberger said.
      He told securities analysts that when the company's common
  dividend is resumed, ""the initial rate will appear conservative
  to you by industry standards and in relation MSU's net income
  and cash flow.""
      ""Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a
  dividend to our common stockholders, he said.""
      The company last paid a common dividend of 44.5 cts a share
  in July 1985.
      Lupberger told the analysts that the company's primary
  objective is ""to create financial strength, enough strength so
  that what happened to us and our stockholders over the past
  couple of years never happens again.""
      The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates
  proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant.
      He said Middle South's net income is expected to post
  ""modest growth"" over the next three years.
      In 1986, the company earned 451.3 mln dlrs or 2.21 dlrs a
  share on revenues of 3.49 billion dlrs.
      Lupberger said, ""A good portion of the improvement
  projected for the next three years comes from keeping the lid
  on operating and maintenance expenses.""

  Brazil's labour unrest is spreading,
  with many banks, universities and government statistical
  offices on strike and more pay disputes looming.
      Bankworkers' leaders said that a national strike launched
  yesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthly
  salary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000
  workforce.
      The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo
  and Rio de Janeiro.
      For the government the one positive development on the
  labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation's
  40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27.
      A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about half
  the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies
  and that the strike looked close to an end.
      Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bank
  strike posing the most serious problems for Brazil's
  crisis-laden economy.
      ""If this goes on for more than a few days it will have a
  serious effect because normal financial operations will grind
  to a halt,"" said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo.
      Today Brazil's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federal
  universities launched a national strike, with a broad political
  demand as well as a pay claim.
      David Fleischer, head of the political science department
  in Brasilia university, told Reuters the National Association
  of Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressional
  inquiry into what had happened to government education funds.
      He said the universities were strapped for cash and that
  the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition
  government, the Liberal Front Party, PFL, of using education
  funds for projects which had helped their candidates in
  elections. The PFL holds the Education Ministry.
      Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to the
  current labour unrest, caused by the return of high inflation,
  officially pegged at 33 pct for January-February.
      Other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oil
  industry workers and social security workers.

  The chairman of the U.S. Senate

      The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading
  agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian
  political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing
  systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity.
      Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the
  resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free
  trade agreement between the two countries, which are each
  other's largest trading partners.
      ""We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both
  countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually
  beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,"" the Texas
  Democrat said in a statement.
      ""I do not question Canada's right to protect its political
  sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases
  mean the government of Canada means to take important economic
  issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply
  concerned,"" he added.
      Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while
  the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He
  said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get
  rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair
  and might not win Senate approval.
      ""I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime
  Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with
  this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did
  when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial
  agreement will be successful,"" Bentsen said.

      Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion
  stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian
  food and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this

  Columbia Gas System Inc said a
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural
  gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25
  dlrs a share.
      The company said ""this could bring earnings for 1987 below
  Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs
  per share dividend."" It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.
      It said management expects to recommend to the board that
  the dividend rate be maintained in 1987.
      Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be
  offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax
  liabilities under the new federal tax laws.
      The company recorded these liabilities based on older,
  higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the
  Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of
  about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.
      ""Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987
  earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,""
  Columbia Gas said.
      Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the
  recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas
  Transmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.
      It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased
  gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to
  amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase
  contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary
  failed to sufficiently support cost recovery.
      The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from
  making a new filing to provide sufficient support.

  The Securities Industry Association
  backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile
  corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider
  trading in law.
      The industry trade association called on U.S. securities
  firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to
  guard against illegal trading by employees.
      The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a
  variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.
      But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to
  continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition
  activities so long as those functions were kept separate.
      The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of
  directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal
  Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock
  exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.
      The report said securities firms ""should be more rigorous in
  restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.""
      It said firms should train their employees to understand
  the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.
      It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid
  expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.
      It said an insider trading definition should exempt a
  securities firm from liability for law violations by its
  employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of
  the wrongdoing.
      In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association
  advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover
  protection plans without prior shareholder approval.
      It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock
  should be required to file a public disclosure statement before
  acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under
  current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after
  exceeding the five pct limit.
      The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a
  company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender
  offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no
  limit on open market purchases.
      The group said the federal government should preempt state
  regulation of defensive takeover tactics.
      The group said all tender offers should remain open for at
  least 30 calendar days.
      The current requirement is expressed in business days.
      It said so-called ""lockup"" devices, in which securities are
  issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend
  off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the
  target company's total common stock.
      Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted
  out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate
  America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading
  and fairness in the marketplace.

  Southwestern Bell Corp said that

      In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the
  regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings
  dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some
  1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its
  debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level
  within an acceptable range.
      In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell
  listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from
  43.7 pct in 1985.
      In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26
  dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share
  in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion
  dlrs.
      Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a
  negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of
  investment tax credits.
      By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate
  tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and
  cash flow.
      In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct
  gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct
  increase in long distance calling volumes.
      Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be
  lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which
  expenditures were held below budget.

  Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a
  takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
  and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock
  brokers said.
      They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
  announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land
  Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
  Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
  billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
      Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
  on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
  But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
  from Liang as long term investment.
      He said Evergo ""was attracted by the underlying strength of
  Hk Hotels.""
      Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
  redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
  hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
  Hk Hotels.
      &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
  pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
      Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
  on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
      ""It is purely coincidence,"" he said.
      But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
  group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
  up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
      Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
  analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
  Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
      Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
  the Hk Hotels board.
      A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
  not considered any countermoves so far.
      Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
  Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
  styles.
      ""Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
  property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
  fit the conservative Kadoorie family,"" said an analyst who asked
  not to be named.
      Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
  distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
  only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
  Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
  current trading price.
      Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
  China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates
  Ltd>.
      Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,

  Kansas City Southern Industries Inc
  said it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern Pacific
  Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp &lt;SFX> if
  the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attempt
  to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa and
  Santa Fe Railway.
      In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlined
  four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.
      Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an
  agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites
  of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that
  the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged
  from today onward.
      ""We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value
  offer in cash for the Southern Pacific,"" said Kansas City
  Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H.
  Rowland.
      ""This offer disproves the constant derogation of the
  Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP
  Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the
  Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'"" said Rowland.
      He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve
  the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the
  independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime
  competitor, Santa Fe.
      Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the
  value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to
  1.2 billion dlrs.
      It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
  Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their
  merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and
  800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.
      Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for
  Southern after its books, records and properties are examined.
      ""Once that examination has been completed (and even in the
  absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an
  offer in writing...."" said the company.
      Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe
  had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's
  reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern
  Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each
  other throughout their routes.
      ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as
  inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning
  for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements
  with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and
  other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

  An investor group said it might be
  willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so
  far the company has turned down requests for a meeting.
      ""We might be able to see some additional value if we could
  meet"" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for
  the investor group.
      Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds
  ""was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this
  time."" Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone
  conversation with Reynolds, Reed said.
      Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>,
  recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The
  offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.
      Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share
  tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp
  gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.
      Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his
  group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and
  entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He
  said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be
  more viable if merged with another tire company.
      ""One option would be to try to grow the tire business
  through combination or an acquisition,"" Reed said. He said he
  believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the
  tire industry.
      Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his
  company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and
  boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit
  sharing have been used with success, he said.
      In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,
  Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's
  shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.
      The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they
  intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc
  &lt;MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the
  station for 387 mln dlrs.
      The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would
  also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to
  Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs
  and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would
  get about 103 mln dlrs.
      The partners also said the Federal Communications
  Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving
  comments on their request for special temporary authorization
  of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal
  application for transfer of the broadcast unit.
      Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule
  because it provides time for the agency to act on the request
  before the expiration of the tender offer.
      He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly
  as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.
      Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by
  some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is
  headquartered, Reed said, ""the plan of the partners offers long
  term growth for Ohio.""
      He noted that the aerospace business, slated for
  divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California.
  ""Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest
  long term growth for all segments,"" he said.

  Treasury Secretary James Baker said
  he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial

  levels.
      ""I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a
  recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals,"" Baker told The Cable
  News Network in an interview.
      ""We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris
  otherwise we would not have been a party too it,"" he said.
      Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to
  ""co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around
  those levels.""
      He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar
  rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently
  tended ""to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say.""
      Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as
  saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that
  triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.
      ""I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that
  international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well,""
  Baker said.

  important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as
  they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade
  imbalances.

      Baker noted that the J-curve, the delayed beneficial effect
  of a weakening of a currency on that country's trade balance,
  takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade
  deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to
  lower the dollar's value.

  Employers and the port union, FNV, are
  to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the
  six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but
  neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told
  Reuters.
      Little progress was made in last night's three hours of
  talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.
      ""There is still a very large gap between the employers and
  the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.
  But at least we are still talking,"" a union spokesman said.
      Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused
  the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all
  over the past two months.
      ""The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am

  unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw

      Commenting on the deficit during an interview on Cable News

9704,"EC LINKS AGRICULTURAL TRADE TALKS TO OTHER REFORM
  The European Community (EC) considers
  talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks
  on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de
  Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.
      He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to
  reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.
      He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule
  agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included
  agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the
  lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.
      Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT
  round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.
      De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day
  conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.
      Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they
  saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for
  urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,
  also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade
  reform was reached as early as possible.
      But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after
  long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.
      ""We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,
  and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one
  undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no
  fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -
  and that's all,"" de Clercq said.
      ""If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my
  priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not the
  only urgent thing,"" he said.
      He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months
  to prepare and eight days of negotiations.

  Engineering group Linde
  AG's &lt;LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in
  the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same
  1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.
      But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln
  marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding
  exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and
  incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.
      Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this
  year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group
  1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.
      Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to
  394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same
  period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.
      Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13
  to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks
  nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum
  issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital
  currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.
      Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the
  necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for
  acquisitions. He declined to give further details.
      While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion
  marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91
  billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of
  the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming
  orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.
      World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4
  pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to
  739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.
      World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05
  billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05
  billion marks.
      Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in
  the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and
  order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in
  the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders
  rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.
      The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group
  sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders
  gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.
      Domestic group turnover rose 8.2 pct to 2.93 billion marks

9733,"BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES
  British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it
  intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil
  Co &lt;SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for
  a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.
      The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc>
  unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
  offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
  being tendered.
      BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
  on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
  advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
  non-public information.
      Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
  1-3/4 dlrs.
      BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
  last night's close.
      About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's
  own resources.
      The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
  banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
  partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
  company said it was in the course of arranging these
  facilities.
      BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's
  investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full
  ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
  made without the limitations of a minority interest.
      BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
  use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
  were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
  investment.
      Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
  changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
  in a lower oil price environment.
      Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
  and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
  tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
      Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.
  One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
  should spend so much money buying a company it already
  controlled.
      BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
  shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
      It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
  the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
  dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
  1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
      Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
  that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
  depend on the reaction of the markets.
      The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59
  pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
      However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
  repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard
  returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from
  its cash flow -- were good.
      Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
      Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
  make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
  production and its downstream activities would push it
  comfortably into surplus.
      BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
  discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had
  inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,
  which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
  oil.
      The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
  reorganisation of Standard in the past year.
      The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was
  now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
  tender offer, Spedding said.
      BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major
  balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
  received in the markets.
      The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
  after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
  -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
  straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
  other sectors.

9734,"HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES
  Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a
  statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a
  fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.
      The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and
  other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure
  on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of
  crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of
  polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.
      World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in
  1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01
  billion from 42.72 billion.
      Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion
  marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.
      The statement made no mention of net profit figures.
  Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.
      In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the
  cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues
  at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the
  previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from
  1986, Hoechst said.
      Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information
  technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.
      Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of
  the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to
  &lt;American Hoechst Corp>.
      Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the
  restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.
      Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated
  partners did not perform as well as in 1985.
      Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax
  profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings
  from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in
  extraordinary costs.
      The fall in raw material prices was not enough to
  compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and
  currencies, Hoechst said.
      The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new
  projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital
  increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the
  acquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>.
      Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to

  Australia's largest company, The Broken

  profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first
  nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters
  said.
      This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the
  first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31
  1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.
      The analysts estimated that the group would report a third
  quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against
  238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.
      BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted
  to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.
      The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in
  petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting
  some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait
  fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and
  steel earnings.
      They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal
  prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been
  affected by industrial and production problems.
      The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's
  lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,
  and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around
  300 mln dlrs.
      One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a
  tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on
  capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.
      They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900
  mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from
  1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would
  be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.

  Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger.
      The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc

  Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either
  later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a
  tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own

      The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take
  the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced
  earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program
  in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be
  used to support that program.
      The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and

      The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue
  cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months
  through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks
  committed to the facility.
      Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility,
  Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among
  BP's relationship banks.
      As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status
  at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at
  75 mln.
      Although pricing on many credit facilities has become
  extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition
  to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be
  compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility
  which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about
  10 days.

9760,"SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR
  World group turnover of Siemens AG
  &lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current
  year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five
  months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
      Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02
  billion marks.
      Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to
  21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about
  19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due
  to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station
  which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.
      In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a
  three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.
      In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8
  billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.
      For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between
  one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.
      Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the
  communications and telecommunications sectors in particular
  should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.
      But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for
  1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the
  dollar, Kaske said.
      Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group
  net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the
  same period in the previous year.
      Turnover in the first five months rose particularly
  strongly in the installations and automotive technology,
  communications and telecommunications sectors, but components
  and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.
      Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in
  the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their
  level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by
  orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.
      Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An
  increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad
  was balanced by the decline in the dollar.
      While the installations and automotive technology sector
  showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and
  communications orders were below the level achieved in the same
  period of 1985/86.
      Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same
  level.
      Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six
  billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous
  year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to
  6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.

9761,"KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS
  The Fried. Krupp GmbH
  &lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory
  1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to
  18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.
      Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
  billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
  16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
      Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
  weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
  falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
      The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
  plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
      Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
  business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
  underpinned machinery and component activities.
      An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
  trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order
  figures.
      However, ""all business sectors contributed to the positive
  results achieved in 1986,"" Krupp added, without giving details.
      Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks
  from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9
  billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of
  orders against 40 pct in 1985.
      Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11
  member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
  rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.
      The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at
  end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
      Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
  three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
      The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
  mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
  foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
  industries.
      The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
  steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
  But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless
  cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.

9763,"NO PESSIMISM FOR GERMAN EXPORTERS, MINISTRY
  Firms need not be pessimistic about export
  prospects even though foreign markets have become more
  difficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministry
  said.
       The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg
  von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could
  start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the
  lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.
      But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no
  need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of
  exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.
      Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but
  noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. ""This
  is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for
  stimulative steps,"" he said.
      The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work
  actively to promote free world trade, he added.
      Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export
  opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in
  international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms
  have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery
  times and good service.
      Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult
  position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure
  to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried
  about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's
  exporters.
      Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,
  tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a
  record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was
  due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the
  decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have
  in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

9764,"MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY
  The monetary authorities of the major
  industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as
  the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and
  widespread central bank intervention, dealers said.
      The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's
  Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West
  Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of
  the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza
  meeting to weaken the dollar, they said.
      The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was
  overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on
  different sides, dealers said.
      Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has
  encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite
  concerted intervention by the central banks of the United
  States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.
      Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for
  action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by
  comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was
  no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.
      Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris
  accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.
      The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul
  Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,
  which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a
  halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they
  noted.
      The situation has again raised the question of whether
  intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge
  currency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to
  intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.
      ""This means that the current dollar selling is not of a
  sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,"" said Koichi
  Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.
      Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the
  intervention and it is only a matter of time before some
  operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in
  Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record
  low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.
      Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to
  rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven
  industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.
      The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus
  Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies
  apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.
      Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be
  used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris
  accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to
  prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.
  Trade deficit, especially with Japan.
      Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a
  lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said.
      The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow
  the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said
  Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
      Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large
  forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills
  falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.
      The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen
  depreciation, dealers said.
      Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks
  ineffective in light of this real demand, they said.
      The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar
  sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new
  business year starting April 1, dealers said.
      ""The market seems to have established a new dollar trading
  range between 147 and 149 yen,"" one dealer said.
      The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris
  accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low
  end for the dollar against the yen, he said.
      Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148
  yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to
  145.

      ""I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea
  and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think
  it's a very good idea,"" Baker said in an interview on Cable
  News Network's ""Moneyline"" television program.
      He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP
  which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal
  Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said
  spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.
      Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by
  House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.
      ""The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate
  approach to take,"" the Treasury Secretary said. He said the
  United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in
  the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.
      On the international front, Baker said banks must do more
  lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this
  after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the
  debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely

  flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the
  economic systems of those countries.
      The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker

  the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
  revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
  for the year.
      Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
  45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
  business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
  transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
  for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
      Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
  also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
  addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
      Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
  in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
  Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
  agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
  lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
      Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
  oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
  transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
      Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
  for Contel Corp &lt;CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
  master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
  equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
  period for repayment starting in December 1988.
      The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
  a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
  Galaxy III transponder lease with &lt;Burnham Leasing> on the
  occurrence of certain events.
      Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
  about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
      Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
  to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
  its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
  lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
  It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
      Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000
  dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln
  dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost
  9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a
  1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on
  revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

  The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion

  of fresh increases in overnight rates.
      The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes
  after the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion
  pesetas.
      A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher
  overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in
  view of disappointing money supply figures for February.
      The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in public
  hands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and
  compared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growth
  was 11.4 pct last year.
      The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a
  quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746
  billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the
  year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising
  demand for funds. ""The policy is proving counter-productive and
  rates will have to come down in the long-term,"" the bank
  spokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries.
      He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term

9907,"DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL
  A large Dutch animal feed compounder
  will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test
  case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied,
  a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het
  Comite, told Reuters.
      Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against
  alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and,
  since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with
  the Business Appeal Court in The Hague.
      The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account
  of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders
  in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in
  their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another
  country.
      Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that
  companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy
  rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain
  commodity board.
      The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and
  legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration
  Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.
      The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company
  for the test case from among the 80 lodged ""because the bill
  (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the
  levy contained significant currency distortions and involved
  grain from a wide variety of origins."" The name of the company
  is not being made public.
      The Administration Court is not expected to make a final
  ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman
  said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal
  Court in Luxembourg, and ""as a result it could easily be another
  nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.""
      Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are
  putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch
  government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a
  complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is
  collected, the spokesman said.
      Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of
  European animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions
  protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.

  Treasury Assistant Secretary David
  Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial
  nations is intended to produce ""reasonable stability"" in exchange
  markets over the next few months.
      He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five
  nations and Canada agreed in Paris to ""see if there can't be a
  period of reasonable stability instead of volatility"" to give
  time for the committments in Paris to take place.
      Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention
  was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that
  the administration judged that after economic adjustments,
  current exchange rates reflect underlying economic
  fundamentals.
      In particular, the stability sought by the nations would
  allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies
  domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford
  said in his testimony.
      He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would
  hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.
      Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was
  affected by international developments.
      He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would
  result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily
  lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm
  asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.
      Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, ""I think
  exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's and
  Japan's) efforts can be carried out.
      Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domestic
  growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower
  dollar.
      Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern
  of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade
  deficit.
      Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved
  either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, both
  alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable.

  earnings by about five cts a share, which would bring the

      Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, not
  including its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mln
  dlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs a
  year earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986.
      He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loans
  which he expects will be ultimately repaid after the company
  recovers from an earthquake earlier this year.
      Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and

      Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the
  acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and
  Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decided
  on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.
      The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens
  at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.
  The result of the negotiations was still open.
      Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.
      The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman
  James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T
  and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the
  U.S.
      Baur said he expected the French government to decide on
  the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French
  switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.
      The French government has limited CGCT participation by
  foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs
  for the whole company.
      Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the
  initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but
  said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.
      Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm

  March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will
  form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.

9975,"GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS
  The Bundesbank's options for West
  Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future
  by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and
  employers, economists and money market dealers said.
      Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to
  3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct
  treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.
      But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely
  to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for
  fear of upsetting the current wage round.
      One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, ""I
  don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever
  happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it
  wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.""
      In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground
  for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments
  of growth and inflation, economists said.
      Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the
  Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,
  raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the
  medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.
      As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move
  that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.
      In the current round, the country's most powerful union,
  the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is
  demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the
  present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.
      The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is
  offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give
  a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this
  year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.
      The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest
  union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the
  benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the
  public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations
  began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by
  early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.
      Though many economists said the unions' current warning
  strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and
  would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week
  strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on
  their positions and there could still be conflict.
      This could extend the length of time in which the
  Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.
      The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the
  protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative
  housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.
      ""The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this
  squarely onto the account in the negotiations,"" he said.
      In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall
  union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than
  his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle
  to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.
      More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in
  south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours
  yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and
  aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.
      Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in
  warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.
      Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates
  would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on
  a politically-inhibited Bundesbank.
      About eight billion marks were coming into the market
  tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.
      As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer
  to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,
  anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.
      But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers
  was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of
  liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,
  perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.
      Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average
  52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first
  24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.

9978,"FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION
  Less than two months after First
  Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica
  Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,
  but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.
      In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for
  ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,
  ""so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our
  independence, if possible.""
      In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major
  East Coast banks to buy banks in California.
      First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and
  the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western
  states and has franchise operations in four additional states.
      Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for
  large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the 
  lucrative California market and the West Coast region.
      While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when
  asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,
  ""That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive
  not to think that.""
      Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as
  ""opportunistic"".
      He said he will look for banks in management trouble that
  he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore
  profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate
  already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.
      The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most
  of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased
  at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.
      Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move
  him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, ""We
  continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of
  people continue to monitor and look at us.""
      Banking analysts, however, consider another First
  Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen
  any time soon.
      Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25
  billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, ""a very,
  very difficult decision.""
      With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First
  Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number
  four position in the California banking community.
      ""The competition in this state is tough,"" he said, noting
  CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches
  from Sears Roebuck company. ""CityBank is moving rapidly to move
  us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,"" he said.
      Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security
  Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,
  Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional
  competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.
      ""Security is, has been and continues to be a highly
  profitable and obviously well managed company,"" he said.
      He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the
  advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer
  and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional
  banks a common name.
      Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good
  financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain
  serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,
  real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.
      Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,
  he said, ""I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think
  most of the problems are real estate-related and the real
  estate problems are going to be with us for several years.""
      Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in
  the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's
  franchise operation.
      First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First
  Interstate financial services in ten states.
      While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise
  operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because
  most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into
  the Midwest must come first.
      Calling the franchise system, ""moderately profitable,""
  Pinola said, ""It is going to take a rejuvenation of the
  agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed
  we were generating before the last year or two.""
      On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks
  1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks
  with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.
